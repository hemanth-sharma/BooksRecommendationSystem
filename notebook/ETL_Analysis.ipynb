It is written with many embedded stories from the A. A. Milne Winnie the Pooh books, both for entertainment and because they serve as tools for explaining Taoism. In the book Piglet is shown to possess great power — a common interpretation of the word Te, which more commonly means Virtue — not only because he is small, but also because he has a great heart or, to use a Taoist term, Tz'u. The book goes through the other characters — Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, Eeyore and Pooh — to show the various aspects of humanity that Taoism says get in the way of living in harmony with the Tao.

After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and reread Middlemarch.

       " \"When Oliver Sacks was twelve years old, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his 'Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far'. It is now abundantly clear that Sacks has never stopped going . . .From its opening pages on his youthful obsession with motorcycles and speed, On the Move is infused with his restless energy. As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California and then in New York, where he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, as well as with a group of patients who would define his life, it becomes clear that Sacks's earnest desire for engagement has occasioned unexpected encounters and travels – sending him through bars and alleys, over oceans, and across continents.With unbridled honesty and humour, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions –bodybuilding, weightlifting, and swimming – also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual, his guilt over leaving his family to come to America, his bond with his schizophrenic brother, and the writers and scientists – Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M. Edelman, Francis Crick – who influenced him.On the Move is the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer – and of the man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human.

       " 'A surprisingly uplifting psychological drama with dark moments and romantic overtones. Dealing with the subjects of domestic psychological, physical and sexual abuse and the lasting damage these do to their victims, it covers twelve years in the lives of two initially unconnected girls, Emma and Helen, both the victims of some form of abuse and the very different consequences this abuse has to both their lives.There are some dark and tragic moments as Emma stumbles from one emotional or physical disaster to the next from the ages of sixteen to twenty-eight. Ultimately it is the realisation of all her clichéd romantic dreams which provides her with the trigger she desperately needs to enable her to take control of her own life. It makes her realise the only way to no longer be a victim is to stop relying on others for emotional and physical stability and to stand on her own two feet. It gives her the courage to face her fears and to do what is right for her daughter.Helen, on the other hand, uses abuse as a weapon with which to defend herself from a world she can not understand. In reality the abuse she has suffered is difficult to define and the line between legitimate psychological damage and inbuilt character traits is blurred.The two girls lives come together with devastating effects.

       " 'From bestselling author Jon Krakauer, a stark, powerful, meticulously reported narrative about a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana \\xad— stories that illuminate the human drama behind the national plague of campus rapeMissoula, Montana, is a typical college town, with a highly regarded state university, bucolic surroundings, a lively social scene, and an excellent football team—the Grizzlies—with a rabid fan base. \\xa0The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities.\\xa0In this, Missoula is also typical. \\xa0A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year.\\xa0Krakauer’s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault. \\xa0Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault — and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman’s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys. \\xa0This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.\\xa0In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula — the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.\\xa0Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor’s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies’ star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman’s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.\\xa0Krakauer’s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention.

Paton translationConsidered one of the most profound, influential, and important works of world philosophy,Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Moralsintroduces his famous Categorical Imperative and lays down a foundation for all of Immanuel Kant's writings. In it, Kant illuminates the basic concept that is central to his moral philosophy and, in fact, to the entire field of modern ethical thought: the Categorical Imperative, the supreme principle of morality, stating that all decisions should be made based on what is universally acceptable. Featuring the renowned translation and commentary of Oxford's H. J. Paton, this volume has long been considered the definitive English edition of Kant's classic text. Kant'sGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Paton writes in his preface, is one of the small books which is truly great: it has exercised on human thought an influence almost ludicrously disproportionate to its size. تأسيس ميتافيزيقا الأخلاق Immanuel Kant\",\n",

       " \"The fascinating letters of Galileo's eldest daughter to her fatherPlaced in a convent at the age of thirteen, Virginia Galilei, Galileo’s eldest daughter, wrote to her father continually. Now Dava Sobel has translated into English all 124 surviving letters that Virginia (renamed Suor Maria Celeste at the convent) wrote to Galileo. The letters span a dramatic decade that included the Thirty Years’ War, the bubonic plague, and the development of Galileo’s own universe-changing discoveries. Suor Maria Celeste’s letters touch on these events, but mostly they focus on details of everyday life that connect her and her father: descriptions of confections she sent to him; news of his estate, which she managed while he was on trial; a request for Galileo to fix the convent clock. Her prose reveals an exceptional woman and presents a memorable portrait of deep affection between a father and daughter.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

       " 'A cookbook showcasing 80 recipes for the most popular of the world\\'s healthiest vegetables--kale, cauliflower, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, leafy greens, and more--tailored to accommodate special diets such as gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian, and vegan.For a long time, brassicas had a mixed reputation. While a small group of people staunchly adored them, most Americans were not as fond of the vegetables formerly known as \"cruciferous\" (who doesn\\'t remember a plate of stinky boiled cabbage or President Bush\\'s condemnation of broccoli?). But in recent years, a transformation has occurred. Kale has taken the world by storm and there\\'s hardly a restaurant left that doesn\\'t have cauliflower on the menu. The rising popularity of brassicas is not only due to their extraordinary health benefits and \"superfood\" status, but also the realization that they can taste delicious when properly prepared. Brassicas shows home cooks how to bring out the flavors of these vegetables without death-by-boiling or burial under a blanket of cheese. When roasted, Brussels sprouts reveal an inherent sweetness. Watercress and arugula add a delightful peppery punch to salads. Caramelizing cauliflower in the sauté pan brings out its best attributes. Celebrating natural flavors rather than masking them, Brassicas both inspires cooks as well as arms them with appetizing new ways to increase their vegetable consumption.

       " 'If we could turn back the clock psychologically, could we also turn it back physically? For more than thirty years, award-winning social psychologist Ellen Langer has studied this provocative question, and now, in Counterclockwise, she presents the answer: Opening our minds to what’s possible, instead of presuming impossibility, can lead to better health–at any age.Drawing on landmark work in the field and her own body of colorful and highly original experiments–including the first detailed discussion of her “counterclockwise” study, in which elderly men lived for a week as though it was 1959 and showed dramatic improvements in their hearing, memory, dexterity, appetite, and general well-being–Langer shows that the magic of rejuvenation and ongoing good health lies in being aware of the ways we mindlessly react to social and cultural cues. Examining the hidden decisions and vocabulary that shape the medical world (“chronic” versus “acute,” “cure” versus “remission”), the powerful physical effects of placebos, and the intricate but often defeatist ways we define our physical health, Langer challenges the idea that the limits we assume and impose on ourselves are real. With only subtle shifts in our thinking, in our language, and in our expectations, she tells us, we can begin to change the ingrained behaviors that sap health, optimism, and vitality from our lives. Improved vision, younger appearance, weight loss, and increased longevity are just four of the results that Langer has demonstrated.Immensely readable and riveting, Counterclockwise offers a transformative and bold new paradigm: the psychology of possibility. A hopeful and groundbreaking book by an author who has changed how people all over the world think and feel, Counterclockwise is sure to join Mindfulness as a standard source on new-century science and healing.

       " 'Identity movements, based on ethnicity, caste, language, religion and regional identity, have become increasingly significant in Nepal, reshaping debates on the definition of the nation, nationalism and the structure of the state. This book analyzes the rapid rise in ethnic and nationalist mobilization and conflict since 1990, the dynamics and trajectories of these movements, and their consequences for Nepal. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the book looks at the roots of mobilization and conflicts, the reasons for the increase in mobilization and violent activities, and the political and social effects of the movements. It provides a historical context for these movements and investigates how identities intersect with forms of political and economic inequality. Nepal’s various identity groups - Dalits, indigenous nationalities, Madhesis and Muslims - have mobilized to different extents. By examining these diverse movements within the same time period and within a unitary state, the book illuminates which factors are more salient for the mobilization of identity groups. Bringing together empirical contributions on key issues in identity production in a comparative perspective, the book presents an interesting contribution to South Asian studies as well as studies of nationalism and identity more broadly.

       " 'Fondato su ricerche d’avanguardia, esposto in modo contagioso e irresistibile, questo libro di esemplare chiarezza si propone come un manuale di science-help, che è cosa ben diversa dal self-help. Negli ultimi anni gli studi cognitivi, le ricerche di psicologia sperimentale e le neuroscienze hanno accumulato una grande quantità di dati sul cervello umano, svelando meccanismi che ci erano completamente oscuri e ridisegnando le nostre conoscenze in questo campo. Così, a mano a mano che ci si addentra nei meandri del nostro cervello e dei suoi comportamenti, avviene che le bizzarre ricette dei guru del benessere psichico o dei sedicenti maestri del successo personale ci appaiano sempre meno plausibili e mostrino tutta la loro debolezza. Con l’avanzare degli studi siamo in effetti sempre più in grado di fornire un altro tipo di «ricette», empiricamente fondate, che ci aiutano a tenere sotto controllo certe evidenti deviazioni di quel prodigioso organo del pensiero che non ha cessato di evolversi da milioni di anni.Per tutto questo, e altro ancora, siamo ora in grado di capire perché spesso ci comportiamo in modo avventato, per non dire apertamente autolesionista, senza un motivo apparente. Il cervello agisce secondo schemi adattativi com-plessi ma prevedibili, e in molte occasioni – specie nella vita dell’uomo moderno – con pessimi risultati. Per dirla con David «Il nostro cervello è una macchina per prevedere e rilevare schemi ricorrenti, che ama la stabilità, la chiarezza e la tutto meraviglioso, tranne quando non lo è».

However, to those who served with Heller in the 340th Bomb Group the novel\\'s characters were indeed recognizable - the hard-drinking, vengeful, and disillusioned Chief White Half Oat, young, sliced-in-half Kid Sampson, shrieking, frenzied Hungry Joe, Colonel Cathcart, General Dreedle, Yossarian and that capitalist supreme, Milo Minderbinder.In this book, written and colorfully illustrated by the daughter of the 340th Bomb Group\\'s commander, Colonel Willis Chapman, we finally encounter the real men and combat missions on which the novel was based. While Heller\\'s fully developed characters stand solely, solidly and uniquely on their own merits, \\'The True Story of Catch-22\\' proves that any resemblance to persons living or dead is, in fact, actual. This three-part book blends fact, fancy, and history with full-blown original illustrations and rare, previously unpublished photos of these daring USAAF flyers and their Corsican-based B-25 Mitchell medium bombers.Along with descriptions of the 340th\\'s real wartime events, the work includes twelve men of the Bomb Group relating twelve richly told tales of their own. Now all of the men upon whom Heller based his characters are gone. However, the last survivor, George L.

       " \"This is the story of the music, politics and culture during a seminal period of the ''baby boom'', 1958-1962. It''s an often hilarious story told from a most unlikely point of view; a precocious child born to a dirt-poor Southern woman. RAISING MAMA is a memoir. The voice is from the point of view of a child who became virtually an adult at age ten. RAISING MAMA is a road trip. Larry Sullivan, the voice and lead character, attends eight schools in five states in five years, 1958-1962. His mother''s favorite husband is a career criminal and, for Larry, reality is one surreal situation after another. RAISING MAMA is an American saga. It''s a love story rivaling ROMEO & JULIET. It''s TOM SAWYER in Jack Kerouac''s world. The stream of consciousness narration is a literate voice from the underclass. Larry and his mother, Dot, are Cherokee descendants and their life is a matriarchy in constant conflict with the dominant culture. Larry is from Memphis, Tennessee and watches Rock ''n Roll being born in his hometown. All women who have committed to a relationship, had a child or participated in the workforce will understand Dot''s plight. Few will understand Dot''s reaction to her circumstances; sometimes hilarious, but frequently tragic. The family is irrevocably affected by the Cold War as Larry''s step-dad tries to go straight for once. There is even a brush with infamy as MAMA works for one night for one of Jack Ruby''s businesses. The narration describes the late 1950''s as they were; with their racial tensions, anti-Communism and the beginnings of Rock ''n Roll and the counter-culture.

Eventually, Mornhavon was captured, and his evil spirit imprisoned in Blackveil Forest. Since that day, the perimeter of Blackveil—now a dark and twisted land—has been protected by the magical D’Yer Wall. But in the centuries since the war’s end, knowledge of the working of magic disappeared from Sacoridia, due to the fear and prejudice of a people traumatized by Mornhavon’s sorceries. Karigan G’ladheon is now a seasoned Green Rider—a member of the magical messenger corps of the king. But during her first year as a Rider, a rogue magician cracked the mighty D’Yer Wall. The spirit of Mornhavon, sensing the weakness, began to wake, seeking vengeance, and causing frightening aberrations throughout the land. Karigan managed to transport the spirit of Mornhavon into the future, buying valuable time for her king and country. But how far in the future is Mornhavon now? A hundred years? Ten? Only one year? There is no way to tell. And though Karigan and her fellow Riders have scoured the land searching for lost magical knowledge, and members of Clan D’Yer are camped at the wall, hoping to uncover its lost secrets, they were unaware of a threat to their kingdom that lay far closer. For there were Arcosian soldiers who survived the Long War, and the descendants of those ancient enemies spent generations honing their powers of dark magic—a force against which the Sacoridians have no defense....

       " \"In the early grades, talking and drawing can provide children with a natural pathway to writing, yet these components are often overlooked. In Talking, Drawing, Lessons for Our Youngest Writers , authors Martha Horn and Mary Ellen Giacobbe invite readers to join them in classrooms where they listen, watch, and talk with children, then use what they learn to create lessons designed to meet children where they are and lead them into the world of writing. The authors make a case for a broader definition of writing, advocating for formal storytelling sessions, in which children tell about what they know, and for focused sketching sessions so that budding writers learn how to observe more carefully.The book's lessons are organized by topic and include oral storytelling, drawing, writing words, assessment, introducing booklets, and moving writers forward. Based on the authors' work in urban kindergarten and first-grade classes, the essence and structure of many of the lessons lend themselves to adaptation through fifth grade. The lessons follow a consistent What's going on in the classroom? What do children need to learn next? Materials needed to teach the lesson Language used in each lesson Reasons behind why certain books are chosen and suggestions for additional children’s books The authors show the thinking behind their teaching decisions and provide a way to look at and assess children's writing, giving us much more than a book of lessons; they present a vision of what beginning writing can look and sound like. Perhaps most powerfully, they give us examples of the language they use with children that reveal a genuine respect for and trust in children as learners.

       " 'Camille Saint-Saëns is a memorable figure not only for his successes as a composer of choral and orchestral works, and the eternally popular opera Samson et Dalila, but also because he was a keen observer of the musical culture in which he lived. A composer of vast intelligence and erudition, Saint-Saëns was at the same time one of the foremost writers on music in his day. From Wagner, Liszt and Debussy to Milhaud and Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was at the center of the elite musical and cultural fin de siècle and early 20th-century world. He championed Schumann and Wagner in France at a period when these composers were regarded as dangerous subversives whose music should be kept well away from the impressionable student. Yet Saint-Saëns himself had no aspirations to being a revolutionary, and his appreciation of Wagner the composer was tempered by his reservations over Wagner the philosopher and dramatist, suspicious as he was of what he called \"the Germanic preoccupation with going beyond reality.\" Whether defending Meyerbeer against charges of facility or Berlioz against those who questioned his harmonic grasp, Saint-Saens was always his own man: in both cases, he claimed, it was \"not the absence of faults but the presence of virtues\" that distinguishes the good composer.Saint-Saëns\\'s writings provide a well-argued counter-discourse to the strong modernist music critics who rallied around Debussy and Ravel during the fin de siècle. And above all, they demonstrate a brilliantly sharp and active brain, expressing itself through prose of a Classical purity and balance, enlivened throughout with flashes of wit and, at times, of sheer malice.In this generously annotated volume, renowned scholar, seasoned translator and radio broadcaster Roger Nichols brings some of the composer\\'s most striking and evocative writings brilliantly to life in English translation, many for the first time. Nichols has carefully chosen these selections for their intrinsic interest as historical documents to create a well-balanced and engaging view of the man, the music, and the age.

He travels to the ancestral river of the Yupik Eskimos to see the only Fair Trade–certified fishing company in the world. He makes clear how PCBs and mercury find their way into seafood; discovers how Mediterranean sea bass went global; challenges the author of Cod to taste the difference between a farmed and a wild cod; and almost sinks to the bottom of the South Pacific while searching for an alternative to endangered bluefin tuna.Fish, Greenberg reveals, are the last truly wild food — for now. By examining the forces that get fish to our dinner tables, he shows how we can start to heal the oceans and fight for a world where healthy and sustainable seafood is the rule rather than the exception.

       " '\"Terre. A sud del tempo\" è una raccolta di versi plurale, sia per il significato duale dell\\'opera, sia per la varietà delle tematiche trattate. Due sono, infatti, le terre a cui il titolo fa riferimento: la prima, fisica, reale, con i paesaggi, le atmosfere, le nature e gli elementi visionari; la seconda, metafisica, ideale, quasi onirica, con le reminiscenze, le suggestioni, le nostalgie e la propensione dell\\'io verso tutto ciò che è ormai perduto. Entrambe si collocano, come esplicitato dal sottotitolo, \"a sud del tempo\", ovvero in una dimensione spazio-temporale lontana dal centro e dal presente. La terra fisica, difatti, è un estremo lembo di meridione (come si evince dal componimento che porta lo stesso titolo della raccolta) che si colloca ai margini del tempo e che persiste nella sua staticità e inviolabilità. Al contrario, la terra metafisica altro non è che una proiezione del passato che, sebbene lontano, si contraddistingue per la sua dinamicità e per il suo ricorrere quasi ossessivo. Terre.

       " 'This sweeping history traces eleven generations of the Clays of Kentucky, a founding American family and Southern dynasty whose members include Henry Clay, who ran for president against James K. Polk; his cousin Cassius Marcellus Clay, a prominent abolitionist and Lincoln’s advisor against slavery; and matriarch Kizzie Clay, who buried the family silver and escaped by flatboat to avoid marauding Union soldiers. The history of the early colonial period comes to life, beginning with the arrival of the Clay family in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1613 and the Cecil family in St. Mary’s, Maryland, in 1634, continuing through their trek across Virginia to the Appalachian Mountains, leading to the families’ eventual intermarriage in 1800 and their move across the mountains to Kentucky and beyond.Drawing from original sources such as Civil War records, land deeds, wills, and letters, and through her own dogged detective work and determination to separate reality from exaggeration to understand the complex legacy she has inherited, Katherine Bateman reveals the adventures, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the men in her family, alongside the deep-rooted stories and nontraditional roles of its strong, sometimes selfish, and proud women.

But when it comes to the inescapable realities of aging and death, what medicine can do often runs counter to what it should.Through eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering this dynamic has produced. Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients’ anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them. And families go along with all of it.In his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures—in his own practices as well as others’—as life draws to a close. And he discovers how we can do better. He follows a hospice nurse on her rounds, a geriatrician in his clinic, and reformers turning nursing homes upside down.

       " \"In September 1928, when great storms were still unnamed, nearly 700 black men, women, and children were buried in an unmarked West Palm Beach ditch following the nation's second-deadliest hurricane. The savage gusts that churned the waters of Lake Okeechobee into a maelstrom of death afflicted victims of all races and classes, and produced tales of survival and loss among whites and blacks alike. The vast majority of the post-storm workers were poor black migrants; even if the hurricane was color-blind, the recovery and rebuilding effort were not. Palm Beach Post hurricane reporter and Florida native Eliot Kleinberg has penned the gripping tale of the killer hurricane. The storm's journey is chronicled as it kills perhaps 7,000 people along its path from the Caribbean to Canada, including a low official tally of 1,836 in Florida alone. Detailing the storm's track, the failure to properly predict landfall, personal battles against nature's wrath, and the extraordinary suffering of a black citizenry forced to provide a disproportionate amount of rebuilding labor and endure the burial of friends and family in an unmarked pit, Kleinberg tells a powerful story of man versus nature and man versus man.

The trenchant and salient, wide-ranging discussion among Assange, Appelbaum, Müller-Maguhn and Zimmermann, is derived from a four-part RT series with additional editorial material and a summarizing prologue by Assange, \"A Call to Cryptographic Arms.\" It is an excellent introduction to the struggle for control of digital communications, economics and governance.

The internet is a threat to human civilization because of its panoptic surveillance and profiling of users. 2. \"Strategic surveillance\" gathers all online and cellphone data as distinguished from tactical surveillance with is specifically targeted. 3. Internet and cellphones allow surveillance more efficiently and pervasively than in the physical world. 4. Individuals can be surveilled more easily if they remain mesmerized by computers, cellphones and social media. 5. Encryption prevents access to private secrets by official and commercial online surveillance and by cellphones. 6. Protestors in Arab Spring went to the streets when cellphone and online systems were disabled and thereby escaped digital surveillance. 7. General purpose computers avoid the built-in controls of special purpose computers and devices. 8. Free software avoids the control of restrictive governmental and commercial software. 9. Free encryption and anonymizing technologies can protect against authoritarian aggression embedded in the equipment and operating systems of computers, cellphones, networks, internet service providers, financial institutions and governments. 10.

       " 'Introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. This text introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. Much of the text is devoted to the key concepts of evolutionary stability and replicator dynamics. The former highlights the role of mutations and the latter the mechanisms of selection. Moreover, set-valued static and dynamic stability concepts, as well as processes of social evolution, are discussed. Separate background chapters are devoted to noncooperative game theory and the theory of ordinary differential equations. There are examples throughout as well as individual chapter summaries. Because evolutionary game theory is a fast-moving field that is itself branching out and rapidly evolving, Jörgen Weibull has judiciously focused on clarifying and explaining core elements of the theory in an up-to-date, comprehensive, and self-contained treatment. The result is a text for second-year graduate students in economic theory, other social sciences, and evolutionary biology. The book goes beyond filling the gap between texts by Maynard-Smith and Hofbauer and Sigmund that are currently being used in the field. Evolutionary Game Theory will also serve as an introduction for those embarking on research in this area as well as a reference for those already familiar with the field. Weibull provides an overview of the developments that have taken place in this branch of game theory, discusses the mathematical tools needed to understand the area, describes both the motivation and intuition for the concepts involved, and explains why and how it is relevant to economics.

Among the crowd are two men who, according to the tradition of the Sport of Kings, should not be associated with the horse who will become its greatest exponent.

It isn't difficult to understand how and why Genet was able to reproduce the novel under such circumstances, because Our Lady Of The Flowers is nothing less than a mythic recreation of Genet's past and then - present history. Combining memories with facts, fantasies, speculations, irrational dreams, tender emotion, empathy, and philosophical insights, Genet probably made his isolation bearable by retreating into a world not only of his own making, but one which he had total control over.

Line by line, Connelly shows how the poem draws on and expresses elements from the thousand years of Buddhist thought that preceded it, expands on the poem’s depiction of a life of simple practice in nature, and tells stories of the way these teachings manifest in modern life. Connelly, like Shitou before him, proves himself adept at taking profound and complex themes from Zen and laying them out in a practical and understandable way.Eminently readable, thoroughly illuminating, Inside the Grass Hut shows the reader a path of wholehearted engagement—with the poem, and with the world.

Pero también arroja luz sobre los desafíos que los jóvenes migrantes tienen al incorporarse a circuitos globales de trabajo bajo un régimen capitalista de acumulación flexible, en el que experimentarán nuevas formas de explotación, precariedad, estigmatización y racismo, así como de resistencia y afirmación personal.A partir de una investigación multisituada con jóvenes zapotecos y tojolabales, se analiza el paso de la militancia en las luchas indígenas a la migración transnacional y la experiencia de estos nuevos migrantes una vez establecidos en Estados Unidos.

Porque los jóvenes no sólo se trasladan miles de kilómetros desde sus pueblos para atravesar la frontera; también experimentan un cambio profundo de sus subjetividades personales y políticas con respecto a la generación anterior.Ellos a diferencia de sus padres, piensan que la vía política, bajo todas sus expresiones, ha fracasado como alternativa para alcanzar una vida mejor; y en cambio, la migración les parece el único destino posible en un país con altos índices de desempleo y un campo devastado por tres décadas de políticas neoliberales.

It is not science fiction.In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the “almighty dollar” plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the “bancor.” In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans. “Deadbeat Nation” being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation.The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies. Once the inheritance turns to ash, each family member must contend with disappointment, but also—as the U.S. economy spirals into dysfunction—the challenge of sheer survival.Recently affluent, Avery is petulant that she can’t buy olive oil, while her sister, Florence, absorbs strays into her cramped household. An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that’s unrecognizable.

This is not to say that I have not been following proven guidelines when it comes to finding family history. For my research clients (mostly pro bono), I actually employ all the methods advocated by many in the genealogy community. However, when it comes to my own research from years ago, I am not walking the walk . . . I have just been talking the talk. It is not always easy to “walk backwards” and review every bit of information gathered over the years. Instead, I wanted to do more than re-walk a trodden I wanted to head out from the same starting point and see where the journey took me. I knew I would have access to better tools, better knowledge and be better equipped for each twist and turn. Now, I encourage you to join me on this journey. The Genealogy Do-Over journey is constructed of 12 Steps that can be easily followed. You can choose to pace yourself as you see fit. You can even decide to drop some of the less important tasks and add your own. Do whatever it takes to ensure that you are on a firm footing to finding your ancestors.

       " 'Las corrientes del espacio es una novela escrita en 1952 por el autor estadounidense de ciencia ficción Isaac Asimov. Es el segundo libro del Tríptico del Imperio Galáctico, que a su vez es la segunda parte de la Saga de la Fundación. El Tríptico del Imperio está ubicado en la época de la Segunda Oleada de Colonización, que avanzó más allá de los Mundos Espaciales, colonizando numerosos planetas de la Vía Láctea. Cada uno de los 3 libros del Tríptico está conectado a los otros libros, separados por un intervalo bastante grande de siglos.La historia ocurre durante el ascenso de Trántor desde ser una gran potencia regional hasta convertirse en un Imperio Galáctico, unificando millones de planetas. Esta historia ocurre alrededor del año 11.000 d. C. (inicialmente 34.500 d. C., según la cronología de Asimov a principios de los años 1950), cuando el Imperio Trantoriano abarca aproximadamente la mitad de la Vía Láctea.El planeta independiente Sark explota al planeta Florina y saca su gran riqueza procedente del kyrt, que es una fibra versátil que sólo puede ser cultivada en Florina. La relación entre los dos planetas es análoga a la situación entre las metrópolis imperiales y sus colonias a mediados del siglo XX, donde fuerzan a los florinianos a trabajar en campos de kyrt y son tratados como una raza inferior por los sarkitas. Los intentos de romper el monopolio de Sark y cultivar kyrt en otros planetas hasta ahora han culminado en fracaso. Mientras tanto, Trántor desea anexionar a su creciente Imperio estos 2 planetas.Hay una broma oculta o una ironía en el dominio de Sark sobre Florina: el paralelo claro con el Sur americano que cultivaba algodón con el trabajo de los esclavos. El floriniano es una de las personas más morenas en una galaxia donde las categorías raciales parecen haber sido olvidadas, excepto por la gente de Sark. Uno de los protagonistas del libro, el doctor Selim Junz, es nativo del planeta Libair, donde viven algunos de los individuos más morenos de la Vía Láctea y siente compasión por los florinianos (el planeta Libair toma su nombre de Liberia, un país en África, que explicaría una herencia genética de piel morena).La posible destrucción de Florina es predicha por Rik, un analista del espacio, cuya mente ha sido manipulada por el dispositivo de la sonda psíquica, causándole amnesia. Cuando Rik comienza a recordar su pasado, provocó una crisis política entre Sark, Florina y Trántor. Rik, nativo de la Tierra, había descubierto que el sol de Florina está a punto de convertirse en una nova porque está siendo alimentado por el carbono del espacio exterior, en las denominadas así \"corrientes del espacio\", que actúan mas bien como corrientes oceánicas.También es revelado al fin y al cabo que la longitud de onda especial enérgica de luz que está siendo emitida por el sol de Florina es lo que permite el cultivo de alta calidad de la fibra kyrt en Florina. Esta es la explicación de porque el kyrt no puede ser cultivado en otros planetas -ya que las estrellas en el proceso de convertirse en novas son muy raras y sobre todo estrellas con planetas habitados-.Sin Florina, Sark perdería su fuente de riqueza, por lo cual hay renuencia en Sark para aceptar la destrucción de Florina. La solución para Trántor es comprar el planeta entero, lo que resultaría ser muy costoso, pero probablemente sería reembolsado en buena voluntad.Incluso aunque no se haya establecido aún el Imperio Galáctico, Trántor controla ya al planeta Tierra, que es en gran parte radioactivo, debido a los hechos relatados en Robots e Imperio. La idea de evacuar la Tierra es mencionada al final del libro, pero es fuertemente rechazada por Rik. Él insiste que la Tierra es el planeta original de la raza humana, aunque esto no sea generalmente aceptado. Las corrientes del espacio Isaac Asimov',\n",

He established his literary career by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems. About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that an influential trustee, Benjamin Orr, had been so impressed by Longfellow's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish and Italian. When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He began publishing his poetry, including Voices of the Night in 1839 and Ballads and Other Poems, which included his famous poem The Village Blacksmith, in 1841.

       " '\"صدق أو لا تصدق\" بهذه العبارة بدأ \"حسن صبرا\" رئيس تحرير مجلة الشراع اللبنانية كتابه الجديد \"جماهيرية الرعب\" وفيه يسجل الكاتب قراءته النقدية لثورة 17/2/2011 حين تناقلت الأنباء أخبار ثورة الشعب الليبي ضد معمر القذافي في الآونة الأخيرة. يقول صبرا عن عمله هذا \"... خطر ببالي لحظة أن أكتب المقدمة بعبارة واحدة هي صدق أو لا تصدق... وهذا ما دفع في خاطري عبارة أخرى كمقدمة تقول: هذا الكتاب يجمع في وقائعه ما هو مضحك وما هو مبكي، ما هو ساخر وما هو جدي وهكذا يمكن اعتبار هذا الكتاب جامع الشرائط. وأضاف: لكن هذا الكتاب هو مجموعة وقائع، وهي كلمة مشتقة من كلمة وقع، واسمها واقع أي أنها حصلت، وفيها شهود مثلما فيها ضحايا، ومجرمين، وكلهم بشر، وهذا ما يجعلها تختلف عن أفلام السينما، ولو أن بطلها وهو معمر القذافي لا يمكن تصديق شخصيته إلا أنها من صنع الخيال... ولعل معمر القذافي هو أول من اعتمد كلمة \"خياله\" تعريباً لكلمة سينما، والخيالة مشتقة من الخيال... وقصص معمر القذافي أغرب من الخيال...\". هذا الكتاب؛ ليس تأريخاً لأحداث، بقدر ما هو قراءة لها، في أسبابها، في تداعياتها، أزاح صبرا عنها الستار لتتعرى أمامنا حقائق مفجعة، تنفث ألماً، وظلماً، تعبر عن رؤيا مثقف عضوي ومفكر مجدد من عالم عربي مشحون بالصراعات والتناقضات، وغياب العدالة، والخوض فيها يتطلب دوماً رجالاً أشداء وسيلتهم الكلمة الحرة والفكر الرزين وهذا ما يميز صبرا عن غيره...نبذة الناشر:\"قصة ثورة شباط/ فبراير الليبية ودور فتحي تربلفضائح القذافي النسائية و((نبوته)) وأصله اليهوديهكذا قتل الامام الصدر وارتكبت مجزرة سجن ابو

بعيدة الاثر تتصل اولاً بالحاضر وتالياً بالمستقبل، ولا تقف فقط عند حدود عبر وأحكام وسمات مستخلصة من تاريخ مضى قريباً كان ام بعيداً. هذا بالنسبة للحدث، اي حدث. فكيف اذا كان الحدث بمستوى ثورة الشعب

كتاب ((جماهيرية الرعب)) لرئيس التحرير الزميل حسن صبرا في بيروت عن الدار العربية للعلوم – ناشرون في طبعته الاولى، وفيه كـمّ هائل من الاسرار والوقائع الخاصة والمرعبة، عاين الكاتب القسم الاكبر منها عن كثب، وكان شاهداً على بعض منها ومتابعاً لبعض آخر ومحققاً او باحثاً عن بعض أخير.الكتاب بفصوله الـ15 وثيقة حية ودامغة عن مرحلة استمرت نحو 41 عاماً في التاريخ الحديث المعاصر قبض خلالها الطاغية معمر القذافي على ليببا الشعب والدولة والمقدرات الهائلة ومارس فيها شتى انواع القمع والارهاب والاذلال والتجهيل بحق الليبيين وتحكم بحكم موقعه بمسارات وأوضاع بالغة التعقيد والاهمية عربياً وافريقياً.. الخ. وهو ما يعرض له الكتاب عبر صفحات مفصلة ونابضة بالوقائع الحية الحقيقية، بشكل تكاد تكون معه شبيهة بفيلم رعب سينمائي استخدم فيه المخرج كل انواع التخويف و الارعاب وتقنيات استخدام الدم والتعذيب.الكتاب لا يعرض سيرة القذافي، الاّ انه يتناولها بكثير من التفصيل، كطباع وعقد نفسية ومسار وصعود وهبوط ومنهجية، ناجحاً في الاحاطة بكل الجوانب المعروفة وغير المعروفة في شخص هذا الامبراطور الطاغية الذي قـلّ نظيره على مـرّ التاريخ. والامر نفسه ينطبق على أولاد القذافي وأبرز رجاله وكذلك أبرز القيادات والاشخاص الذين ارتبطت اسماؤهم بالعقود القذافية الاربعة السابقة في ليبيا والمنطقة، الى درجة يصح معها القول انه كتاب جامع لأهم وأبرز المحطات في سير هؤلاء، ليس فقط من خلال ذكر بعض الوقائع المثبتة والاكيدة والخاصة، بل وايضاً من خلال إماطة اللثام عما خفي في حياة القذافي وهؤلاء من علاقات شخصية ونسائية عـبّـرت عن أمزجة عليلة وفاجرة لا شأن لها الاّ العبث بالمصائر أفراداً وشعوباً، والتلذذ بذلك في نزعات سادية مكبوتة او ظاهرة، في استعادة ممسوخة لمدعي الالوهة قبل التاريخ المكتوب او استعادة متفلته من اية ضوابط لمشاهد

كمخضرم في عالم الكتابة والصحافة والسياسة والفكر على مدى نحو نصف قرن. ولعل ذلك كان وراء العناية الفائقة التي أولاها لقصة ثورة شباط/ فبراير من دون اغفال قصة انقلاب القذافي وسيطرته على مقدرات الليبيين

       " 'Acclaimed as the Middle East’s \"All Quiet on the Western Front\"The first eye-witness account ever published of the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, this riveting memoir of a young Israeli soldier became an instant bestseller on publication in 1949, and is still recognized as the outstanding book of that war, in the tradition of Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front. First joining the Givati Brigade and later volunteering for \"Samson’s Foxes\", the legendary commando unit, Avnery took part in almost all the major battles on the Jerusalem and southern fronts. Written from the trenches, and from a military hospital bed, he offers an extraordinarily detailed account of the war, of fast-paced battles, and acts of extreme bravery, as well as the camaraderie and off-duty exploits of young men and women thrust into the front line. This is a gripping, sensitive, and at times deeply poignant account of the day-to-day brutalities of one of the most significant wars of our times. 1948: A Soldier\\'s Tale - The Bloody Road to Jerusalem Uri Avnery',\n",

       " \"Neo-paganism is the attempt to revive the polytheistic religions of old Europe. But how? Can one just invent or reinvent an authentic, living faith? Or are modern neo-pagans just engaged in elaborate role-playing games? In SUMMONING THE GODS, Collin Cleary argues that the gods have not died or forsaken us so much as we have died to or forsaken them. Modern civilization-including much of modern neo-paganism-springs from a mindset that closes man off to the divine and traps us in a world of our own creations. Drawing upon sources from Taoism to Heidegger, Collin Cleary describes how we can attain an attitude of openness that may allow the gods to return. In these nine wide-ranging essays, Collin Cleary also explores the Nordic pagan tradition, Tantrism, the writings of Alain de Benoist, Karl Maria Wiligut, and Alejandro Jodorowski, and Patrick McGoohan's classic television series The Prisoner. Cleary's essays are models of how to combine clarity and wit with spiritual depth and intellectual sophistication. Summoning the Gods Collin Cleary\",\n",

Then, he makes the long trek back to Snoopy's neck of the woods accompanied by his only friend (a cactus, of course) and throughout the rest of the book, pops up in hilarious, Waiting for Godot-style vignettes set in his native Needles.In romantic news, the Peppermint Patty-Marcie-Charlie Brown love triangle of overlapping unrequited love heats up (well, kind of), while Linus continues to vociferously deny that he is Sally's Sweet Babboo; of course, Lucy's unsuccessful pursuit of Schroeder remains unabated. Also, a romance blossoms between two of Snoopy's Beagle Scout birds. (We will pass over Spike's brief attraction to one of the coyotes.)In what is probably his most baroque and hilarious baseball-involved humiliation yet, Charlie Brown agrees to join Peppermint Patty's team, the Pelicans, only to discover that he's wanted not as a player but as a mascot. Linus gives up his security blanket and forms a support group for other kids who are trying to do the same, and Peppermint Patty manages to be held back in school (leaving a snoring ghost to take her place in the rest of the class that has advanced), and yet gets to go on a European trip with her dad, sending back periodic dispatches from the road. All this, plus appearances from Franklin, Rerun, and the rest of the gang in these strips from a period of Peanuts that's far less well-known than the endlessly-collected 1960s and 1970s eras.

These poems are an invitation into a world that is intimate and wondrous, one that explores the depths of all human hearts.

This classic sociological study gives a concise, accessible introduction to Islam for Americans whose knowledge of religion is limited primarily to Judeo-Christianity. The book succinctly details the formation and development of the Black Muslim movement through its wide-ranging expressions in America today — a movement born as an organized form of religious and social protest against a society sharply divided by race. This edition includes a new foreword by Aminah B. McCloud, a new preface, and an extensive postscript by Lincoln in which he outlines the course of the Nation of Islam since the death of its formative leader, Elijah Muhammad, in 1975 — the sweeping changes wrought by Elijah\\'s son and successor, Wallace Deen Muhammad, the disintegration of the Nation into splinter groups, and the emergence of Louis Farrakhan as the legitimate head of the \"new\" Nation. A section highlighting the public career of Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad\\'s famous spokesperson turned cultural icon, is also included. In the wake of recent media events like the film Malcolm X and unsettling national events like the riot in Los Angeles, this timely update provides both fascinating reading and challenging reflection about an American religious group still shaping its destiny, and that of the nation.

       " \"There are 168 hours in a week. This book is about where the time really goes, and how we can all use it better.It's an unquestioned truth of modern we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way-and Laura Vanderkam has found one. After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there's time for the important stuff. They focus on what they do best and what only they can do. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer. It's not always easy, but the payoff is enormous. Vanderkam shows that it really is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter. The key is to start with a blank slate and to fill up your 168 hours only with things that deserve your time. Of course, you probably won't read to your children at 2:00 am, or skip a Wednesday morning meeting to go hiking, but you can cut back on how much you watch TV, do laundry, or spend time on other less fulfilling activities. Vanderkam shares creative ways to rearrange your schedule to make room for the things that matter most. 168 Hours is a fun, inspiring, practical guide that will help men and women of any age, lifestyle, or career get the most out of their time and their lives. 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think Laura Vanderkam\",\n",

Wenfang Tang attempts to explain the seemingly contradictory trends of the increasing number of protests on the one hand, and the results of public opinion surveys that consistently show strong government support on the other hand. The book points to the continuity from the CCP's revolutionary experiences to its current governing style, even though China has changed in many ways on the surface in the post-Mao era. The book proposes a theoretical framework of Populist Authoritarianism with six key elements, including the Mass Line ideology, accumulation of social capital, public political activism and contentious politics, a hyper-responsive government, weak political and civil institutions, and a high level of regime trust. These traits of Populist Authoritarianism are supported by empirical evidence drawn from multiple publicopinion surveys conducted from 1987 to 2015. Although the CCP currently enjoys strong public support, such a system is inherently vulnerable due to its institutional deficiency. Public opinion can swing violently due to policy failure and the up and down of a leader or an elite faction. The drastic change of public opinion cannot be filtered through political institutions such as elections and the rule of law, creating system-wide political earthquakes.

TO OUR When it comes to book reviews, there is a difference between speaking out one’s opinion and arranging a batch of negative reviews (for psychological or materialistic reasons). The arranged one- and two-star book reviews are typically posted within about one week. Then, they are up voted over the course of a few days so that they become the first thing readers see when they visit the book’s page. We encourage our readers to be cautious when relying on such reviews. This is not the actual Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty First Century. The primary objective of this book is to bring insightful discussion and critique of Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty First Century to readers everywhere. This book includes a critique of Thomas Piketty’s book, as well as the review of the future of economic inequality forecasted by other experts. Do not purchase this critique of the book if you are looking for a full copy of Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty First Century Income inequality in the United States and in Western Europe has been growing since the 1970s. In the US, the top 1 percent income share has more than doubled in the course of the last thirty years, drawing much public attention. In 2013, the thousand richest individuals in the UK had their wealth increased by 15 percent. At the same time, the UK government enacted a one percent pay freeze on public sector workers, re-enforcing the lengthiest wage squeeze since the 1870s. Modern capitalistic society is an unequal society, and that inequality grows fast due to the rich-get-richer trend. In his book, Piketty argues that as long as the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth, the income and wealth of the rich will grow faster than the typical income from work. This trend will continue to support rising economic inequality. In our critique of Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, we examine issues raised in Piketty’s book, for the benefit of those who wish to read or study Piketty’s book in the future.

       " 'Originally published in German in 1935, this monograph anticipated solutions to problems of scientific progress, the truth of scientific fact and the role of error in science now associated with the work of Thomas Kuhn and others. Arguing that every scientific concept and theory—including his own—is culturally conditioned, Fleck was appreciably ahead of his time. And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, \"Though much has occurred since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely unexploited resource.\"\"To many scientists just as to many historians and philosophers of science facts are things that simply are the they are discovered through properly passive observation of natural reality. To such views Fleck replies that facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction, a made thing. A work of transparent brilliance, one of the most significant contributions toward a thoroughly sociological account of scientific knowledge.\"—Steven Shapin, Science Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact Ludwik Fleck',\n",
       " 'In his pioneering treatise on education the great French philosopher presented concepts that had a significant influence on the development of pedagogy, and yet many of his ideas still sound radical today. Written in reaction to the stultifying system of rote learning and memorization prevalent throughout Europe in Rousseau\\'s time, Emile is a utopian vision of child-centered education, full of the sentiments of Romanticism, which Rousseau himself inspired.Imagining a typical boy named Emile, Rousseau creates an ideal model of one-on-one tutelage from infancy to manhood with himself as the child\\'s mentor. \"Everything is good as it comes from the hands of the Author of Nature; but everything degenerates in the hands of man.\" This is the first of many provocative statements that characterize this work and are a hallmark of Rousseau\\'s arresting rhetoric. As in so many of his other famous works, here too Rousseau asserts his main thesis that human beings by nature are good; it is only the distorting influences of civilization that have corrupted them.If this is true, then in educating children one must do nothing to interfere with human nature in its natural course. Far from being the chief means by which society inculcates its rules and principles, education should be the method of helping youths discover the inherent truths of their own human nature. From infancy to young adulthood learning should come purely from personal experience. Rather than imparting facts, teachers should foster self-discovery, so that knowledge is acquired through following innate curiosity, not vicariously through the statements of others.Educators as well as students of philosophy will find much to admire in Rousseau\\'s original and still radical ideas.

       " 'Originally published in 1893 and never out of print, Emile Durkheim’s groundbreaking work remains one of the cornerstone texts of the sociological canon—now updated and re-translated in this new edition.As the Industrial Revolution was changing the landscape of society, Durkheim presented a new vision of the social structures at the root of capitalism, and the issues he grappled with still resound today. If pre-industrial societies were held together by common values, sentiments, and norms, equally shared by all, what holds modern societies, with their complex division of labor and non-cohesive social structure, together? What did this new social order mean for the autonomy of the individual? Durkheim argued that class conflict is not inherent in a capitalist society, as Marx contended, but that the unfettered growth of state power would lead to the extinction of individuality. Only in a free society that promotes voluntary bonds between its members, Durkheim suggested, can individuality prosper.In this new edition, the first since 1984, world-renowned Durkheim scholar Steven Lukes revisits and revises the original translation to enhance clarity, accuracy, and fluency for the contemporary reader. Lukes also highlights Durkheim’s arguments by putting them into historical context with a timeline of important information. For students and scholars, this edition ofThe Division of Laboris essential reading and key to understanding the relevance of Durkheim’s ideas today.

       " \"Emile is a philosophical treatise on education written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century. The book is divided into five parts, each of which explores a different stage of a hypothetical boy's life and the education he should receive at that stage. In the first part, Rousseau discusses the importance of natural education and the role of the tutor in guiding the child's development. The second part focuses on the physical development of the child, including the importance of exercise and outdoor activities. The third part delves into the moral and intellectual education of the child, emphasizing the importance of cultivating a sense of morality and virtue in the child. The fourth part explores the role of religion in education, arguing that it should be based on natural religion rather than dogma. Finally, the fifth part discusses the education of women, arguing that they should receive an education that is equal to that of men. Throughout the book, Rousseau emphasizes the importance of allowing the child to develop naturally and avoiding the constraints of society and tradition. Emile is considered a groundbreaking work in the field of education and has had a significant impact on educational theory and practice. It has been praised for its emphasis on individualism and natural development, but also criticized for its rejection of traditional forms of education and its limited view of women's roles in society.Our inner conflicts are caused by these contradictions. Drawn this way by nature and that way by man, compelled to yield to both forces, we make a compromise and reach neither goal. We go through life, struggling and hesitating, and die before we have found peace, useless alike to ourselves and to others.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.

Lovett Weems, one of the most highly-respected interpreters of contemporary United Methodism, suggests that we start with the- What will happen now that the increased giving that United Methodists have enjoyed (despite declining membership numbers) has reached a plateau and begun to decline?- Why, with 34,000 congregations and $6.5 billion in annual giving, can’t United Methodists add a net increase of even 1 new disciple of Jesus Christ in a given year?- Why are United Methodist clergy less concerned with reaching young adults than are laity? Why are laity unwilling to make the changes to worship and budgets required to attract these same young adults?- If the percentage of married couples with young children has declined by half since the 1950s, why is that still the group we focus on reaching?- Why are so many mid-sized churches on their way to becoming small-membership congregations?With insight, conviction, and calm resolve, Lovett Weems challenges United Methodists not only to ask these hard questions, but to face up to the difficult decisions they require of us as we continue to seek God’s will for our lives together.

       " 'Educational reform is one of the most critical issues facing our cities, but some cities are better at it than others. To explain why, this book relates education to politics, showing how the \"whole village\" can be mobilized to better educate tomorrow\\'s citizens.City Schools and City Politics is based on an eleven-city NSF study of civic capacity and urban education. As participants in that study, the authors conducted research in three rustbelt cities that have lost much of their tax base and have legacies of machine politics. They analyzed the ways in which government, business, and community leaders create, or fail to create, civic support for public education, focusing on why certain cities show greater initiative than others in addressing these problems.The authors reveal that, of the cities examined, Pittsburgh has made the most strides in educational reform, followed by Boston, while St. Louis has consistently lagged behind. Their observations show that cross-sectorial coalitions are essential for bringing about change; that organizational arrangements in the business community and their relationship to local government affect whether there is the capacity to address school reform; that leadership is critical in bringing about change; and that municipal institutions and culture influence a city\\'s ability to take action.Packed with empirical data and analysis, City Schools and City Politics demonstrates the citywide and long-term character of successful efforts to reform public schools, relating education to the priorities of municipal governments and describing the conditions under which reform becomes possible. It extends regime theory to public education and shows that education policy is inextricably linked with urban political life and is an issue of real concern to political science.

The stories combine elements of realism and poetry, beauty and ugliness, tenderness and irony. Graham Greene, writing in the Spectator, lauded the collection as “the first volume of Mr. Bates’s maturity” and Bates as “an artist of magnificent originality with a vitality quite unsuspected hitherto.”This is brilliantly demonstrated in the title story, “The Woman Who Had Imagination,” the heart-rending story of an Italian woman, revealed through the casual meetings and conversations that take place on a day’s outing of a country choir.The contrast between “The Waterfall,” with its melancholy and grace, and the disturbing tensions in “The Brothers.” emphasizes Bates’s mastery of both the delicate and the disquieting. It is also in this collection that we are introduced to the much-loved comic narrator, Uncle Silas, in “The Lily,” “The Wedding.” and “Death of Uncle Silas.”In addition to the original collection this edition includes two extra stories. “The Country Doctor” concerns a woman’s grief on the death of her dearest friend. It was first published in the Fortnightly Review in 1931 with the title “The Country Sale,” and later in the limited edition The Story Without an End and The Country Doctor (White Owl Press, 1932), and has not been reprinted since.“The Parrot” chronicles a man, a marriage and the eponymous parrot, and has only previously been published in 1928 in T.P.’s Weekly, founded by the radical MP, T.P.

Bran assembles a group, including a very cautious thief, twin girls and the strong man Mill the Hill, as well as Swart, a brother of one of the lost slaves. They set out for their first mission by train, for a place now called The Rat's Town, where Bran meets a transmitting empath called Scathe, who joins the group as they go further; first to find the lightning maker, the Stormbringer and then, further still, to return to find that their minds are not their own, and that their very worst nightmares are becoming very real indeed.

       " '\"A brilliant work of social archaeology....A major historical contribution.\"―Adam Goodheart, The New York Times Book Review The nineteenth century was a golden age for those people known variously as sodomites, Uranians, monosexuals, and homosexuals. Long before Stonewall and Gay Pride, there was such a thing as gay culture, and it was recognized throughout Europe and America. Graham Robb, brilliant biographer of Balzac, Hugo, and Rimbaud, examines how homosexuals were treated by society and finds a tale of surprising tolerance. He describes the lives of gay men and women: how they discovered their sexuality and accepted or disguised it; how they came out; how they made contact with like-minded people. He also includes a fascinating investigation of the encrypted homosexuality of such famous nineteenth-century sleuths as Edgar Allan Poe\\'s Auguste Dupin and Sherlock Holmes himself (with glances forward in time to Batman and J. Edgar Hoover). Finally, Strangers addresses crucial questions of gay culture, including the riddle of its relationship to religion: Why were homosexuals created with feelings that the Creator supposedly condemns? This is a landmark work, full of tolerant wisdom, fresh research, and surprises.31 illustrations Strangers: Homosexual Love in the Nineteenth Century Graham Robb',\n",

       " 'How Music Works is David Byrne’s remarkable and buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.Acting as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns—and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).Touching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, How Music Works is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music’s liberating, life-affirming power.

Pride and Prejudice , one of the most famous love stories of all time, has also proven itself as a treasured mainstay of the English literary canon. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity. Misconceptions and hasty judgements bring heartache and scandal, but eventually lead to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. It’s almost impossible to open Pride and Prejudice without feeling the pressure of so many readers having known and loved this novel already. Will you fail the test - or will you love it too? As a story that celebrates more unflinchingly than any of Austen’s other novels the happy meeting-of-true-minds, and one that has attracted the most fans over the centuries, Pride and Prejudice sets up an echo chamber of good feelings in which romantic love and the love of reading amplify each other.

       " 'Example in this ebookThose to whom the Life of Pascal and the Story of Port Royal are unknown, must be referred to works treating fully of the subject, since it were impossible to deal with them adequately within the limits of a preface. Sainte-Beuve\\'s great work on Port Royal, especially the second and third volumes, and \"Port Royal,\" by Charles Beard, B.A., London, 1863, may best be consulted by any who require full, lucid, and singularly impartial information.But for such as, already acquainted with the time and the man, need a recapitulation of the more important facts, or for those who may find an outline map useful of the country they are to study in detail, a few words are here given.Blaise Pascal was born at Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne, on June 19, 1623. He sprung from a well-known legal family, many members of which had held lucrative and responsible positions. His father, Etienne Pascal, held the post of intendant, or provincial administrator, in Normandy, where, and at Paris previously, Pascal lived from the age of sixteen to that of twenty-five; almost wholly educated by his father on account of his precarious health. His mother died when he was eight years old. Etienne Pascal was a pious but stern person, and by no means disposed to entertain or allow any undue exaltation in religion, refusing as long as he lived to allow his daughter Jaqueline to take the veil. But he had the usual faiths and superstitions of his time, and believing that his son\\'s ill-health arose from witchcraft, employed the old woman who was supposed to have caused the malady to remove it, by herbs culled before sunrise, and the expiatory death of a cat. This made a great impression on his son, who in the \"Thoughts\" employs an ingenious argument to prove that wonders wrought by the invocation of the devil are not, in the proper sense of the term, miracles. At any rate the counter-charm was incomplete, as the child\\'s feeble health remained feeble to the end.Intellectually, Blaise Pascal grew rapidly to the stature and strength of a giant; his genius showing itself mainly in the direction of mathematics; at the age of fifteen his studies on conic sections were thought worthy to be read before the most scientific men of Paris, and in after years of agonizing pain mathematical research alone was able to calm him, and distract his mind from himself. His actual reading was at all times narrow, and his scholarship was not profound. In 1646, his father, having broken his thigh at Rouen, came under the influence of two members of the Jansenist school of thought at that place, who attended him in his illness, and from that time dated the more serious religious views of the family. Jaqueline was from the first deeply affected by the more rigorous opinions with which she came in contact. Forbidden to enter the cloister, she lived at home as austere a life as though she had been professed, but after her father\\'s death won her brother\\'s reluctant consent to take the veil at Port Royal, and became one of the strictest nuns of that rigid rule.To be continue in this ebook..................................................................................

Lucas has been instructed to somehow gain the great writer\\'s trust and friendship, but all the agent\\'s cool intellect and training has left him unprepared to withstand the human whirlwind known as \"Papa.\"Hemingway has assembled a spy ring that he calls the \"Crook Factory\"--including an American millionaire, a twelve-year-old Cuban orphan, a Spanish jai alai champion, a priest, and a fisherman, among others--to play a dangerous game of amateur espionage.

It is a novel of honor, passion, and deadly conspiracy.And it could very well have happened...Interestingly, about 75% of the stuff in this book actually happened.

       " 'A riveting true crime story that vividly recounts the birth of modern forensics.At the end of the nineteenth century, serial murderer Joseph Vacher, known and feared as “The Killer of Little Shepherds,” terrorized the French countryside. He eluded authorities for years—until he ran up against prosecutor Emile Fourquet and Dr. Alexandre Lacassagne, the era’s most renowned criminologist. The two men—intelligent and bold—typified the Belle Époque, a period of immense scientific achievement and fascination with science’s promise to reveal the secrets of the human condition. With high drama and stunning detail, Douglas Starr revisits Vacher’s infamous crime wave, interweaving the story of how Lacassagne and his colleagues were developing forensic science as we know it. We see one of the earliest uses of criminal profiling, as Fourquet painstakingly collects eyewitness accounts and constructs a map of Vacher’s crimes. We follow the tense and exciting events leading to the murderer’s arrest. And we witness the twists and turns of the trial, celebrated in its day. In an attempt to disprove Vacher’s defense by reason of insanity, Fourquet recruits Lacassagne, who in the previous decades had revolutionized criminal science by refining the use of blood-spatter evidence, systematizing the autopsy, and doing groundbreaking research in psychology. Lacassagne’s efforts lead to a gripping courtroom denouement. The Killer of Little Shepherds is an important contribution to the history of criminal justice, impressively researched and thrillingly told.From the Hardcover edition.

       " '\"The fish\\'s streamlined shape reveals functional knowledge ofthe physical properties of water.... The deadly effectiveness of the cobra\\'s venom shows useful knowledge of the physiology of its prey.... Indeed, knowledge itself may be broadly conceived as the fit of some aspect of an organism to some aspect of its environment, whether it be the fit of the butterfly\\'s long siphon of a mouth to theflowers from which it feeds or the fit of the astrophysicist\\'s theories to the structure of the universe.... But how did such remarkable instances of fit arise? How did the animate world obtain its impressive knowledge of its surroundings? And how do organismscontinue to acquire knowledge and thereby increase their fit during their lifetimes?\" In this sweeping account of the emergence of fit, Gary Cziko integrates numerous scientific disciplines within the perspective of a universal selection theory that attempts to account for all cases of fit involving living organisms, including those that might appear miraculous. Cziko\\'s bold assertion is that all novel forms of adapted complexity—whether single-celled organisms or scientific theories—emerge from an evolutionary process involving cumulative blind variation and selection. Without Miracles describes many remarkable examples of the fit of various structures, behaviors, and products of living organisms to their environments in a broad synthesis of humankind\\'s attempt to understand the emergence of complex, adapted entities. These explanations range from the providential accounts of the early philosophers and \"natural theologians,\" through instructionist theories of the type proposed by Lamarck, to an ongoing \"second Darwinian revolution\" in which natural and artificial selection are being applied to many fields of science to both explain the emergence of naturally occurring adapted complexity and to facilitate the design of useful products ranging from microbes to computer programs. The evolution of explanations of fit from providential through instructionist to selectionist theories, Cziko argues, has occurred repeatedly in many different fields of knowledge along with a growing realization that the Darwinian mechanism of cumulative blind variation and selection is the only tenable nonmiraculous explanation for the emergence of any kind of functional complexity. Cziko applies this provocative selectionist thesis to a stunning range of domains including biology, immunology, neuroscience, ethology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, education, linguistics, and computer science. The result is an up-to-date, clearly summarized collection of selectionist arguments that shows how our knowledge of the emergence of fit has itself evolved and continues to do so.

Beautifully written, filled with myriad period details and compelling characters, it takes you deep into the heart of a brutal era -- and into the nature of feminine honor, feminine courage. I was enthralled. - JENNIFER BLAKE, NY Times Bestselling Author__________Elsbeth of Olmsbury desires nothing beyond helping her father run his dukedom - until the duke's forces are overwhelmed, his castle torched and Elsbeth seized for the invading king's personal spoil. Expecting the same abuse as the other surviving women of her house, Elsbeth instead finds the king, Leodegrance, treating her with a civility that belies his flagrant desire for her. A desire that will have her his consort in Cameliard once he can convince her rank and duty alone forced his hand against her father.But Elsbeth is not so easily won. There is the matter of Leodegrance gifting his steward with an unwilling young handmaid from Elsbeth's household. Of his marriage of convenience to his Byzantine queen. And of his plans to subjugate more of Britain's citadels and unite the wild isle under Roman rule.If Elsbeth can't find her tangled way to forgiveness with the king - or escape the dark designs and perverse desires of Uther Pendragon, enemy to them both - then a legend of Camelot may never be conceived, never be born, and never change history forever ...__________Please This novel takes place in a harsh era when spoils were often treated as commodities.

But in an eye-opening account,Base Nationshows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills—and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine’s accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy.Base Nationis an essential contribution to that debate.

       " 'In Matt Sumell\\'s blazing first book, our hero Alby flails wildly against the world around him—he punches his sister (she deserved it), \"unprotectos\" broads (they deserved it and liked it), gets drunk and picks fights (all deserved), defends defenseless creatures both large and small, and spews insults at children, slow drivers, old ladies, and every single surviving member of his family. In each of these stories Alby distills the anguish, the terror, the humor, and the strange grace—or lack of—he experiences in the aftermath of his mother\\'s death. Swirling at the center of Alby\\'s rage is a grief so big, so profound, it might swallow him whole. As he drinks, screws, and jokes his way through his pain and heartache, Alby\\'s anger, his kindness, and his capacity for good bubble up when he (and we) least expect it. Sumell delivers \"a naked rendering of a heart sorting through its broken pieces to survive.*\"Making Niceis a powerful, full-steam-ahead ride that will keep you laughing even as you try to catch your breath; a new classic about love, loss, and the fine line between grappling through grief and fighting for (and with) the only family you\\'ve got.*Mark Richard Making Nice: A Novel in Stories Matt Sumell',\n",

       " \"The glory of the Leibstandarte SS Adolph Hitler was their ambition even if death was the price - and of the of the 30,000 SS soldiers who signed up with this elite force only thirty would survive the war. Some perished in the abortive push on Normandy directed by the Fuhrer. Others suffered gruesome deaths in the hands of the Russians. But wherever they went they left a trail of terror as they butchered their way across Europe. In a chilling day-by-day account of the final year of this crack squad, Charles Whiting chronicles their bloody demise which culminated in humiliation at the Battle of the Bulge. CHARLES WHITING, the author, is Britain's most prolific military writer with over 250 books to his credit. He saw active service in the Second World War, serving in an armoured reconnaissance regiment attached to both the US and British Armies. He is therefore able to write with the insight and authority of someone who, as a combat soldier, actually experienced the horrors of World War II.
