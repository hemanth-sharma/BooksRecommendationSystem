A loving wife, children, sex, and companionship were among the list. His wife indeed loved him, but soon after they wed she would be bratty for no reason, or none that was disclosed to him.He would attempt to woo her back into his fun loving wife, but instead she would pout for days. It became apparent that something needed to change. And it wasn\u2019t Elliott. He hadn\u2019t changed the terms of their marriage, Susana had.She was deliberately destroying their marriage, even if she didn\u2019t know it. It was then, that day, while he was having a men\u2019s night out at the bar, he came up with a resolution. Turns out not just his marriage was failing, so were the twelve men he was with.These men loved their wives, adored them. They didn\u2019t want some Stepford wife, they wanted their wives back. Elliott founded the Birch Society in 2002 and for the last twelve years it had grown by leaps and bounds, just as his marriage had.The last twelve years he and Susana had consensually practiced Domestic Discipline. They went into it with their eyes and ears open, ready to change their marriage.

Electioneering on the Senate floor, playing games with the legislative process, and questioning your fellow senators' motives have become commonplace.In this book, noted political scientist Sean Theriault documents the Senate's demise over the last 30 years by showing how one group of senators has been at the forefront of this transformation. He calls this group the \"Gingrich Senators\" and defines them as Republican senators who previously served in the House after 1978, the year of Newt Gingrich's first election to the House. He shows how the Gingrich Senators are more conservative, more likely to engage in tactics that obstruct the legislative process, and more likely to oppose Democratic presidents than even their fellow other Republicans. Phil Gramm, Rick Santorum, Jim DeMint, and Tom Coburn are just four examples of the group that has includes 40 total senators and 22 currently serving senators.Theriault first documents the ideological distinctiveness of the Gingrich Senators and examines possible explanations for it. He then shows how the Gingrich Senators behave as partisan warriors, which has radically transformed the way the Senate operates as an institution, by using cutthroat tactics, obstructionism, and legislative games. He concludes the book by examining the fate of the Gingrich Senators and the future of the U.S. Senate.",

        "description": "Sir Ian Botham and the Ashes are as closely intertwined as willow and leather or Merv Hughes and his moustache. You simply cannot think of one without the other. In this book, Sir Ian takes you on a ride through a lifetime's relationship with cricket's oldest and most treasured prize, revealing just how it has shaped his life and how he has helped to turn it into the contest it is today. From the moment he first watched the likes of Ken Barrington stride to the wicket in jaw-jutting defiance to the day he flayed Australia's bowling attack around Headingley as if playing with his mates in the park, and then onwards to his role in commentating on what was arguably the finest series of the lot in 2005, Sir Ian has a rich and varied connection with the Ashes, and he tells all here. The Ashes is a series that has provided incredible highs and heartbreaking lows for English and Australian fans alike over the past 35 years. Sir Ian has often been at the center of the roller-coaster ride. Whether it is the story of his days as England's dogsbody in 1974 in Melbourne or the refusal to let Bob Willis bowl downwind until he was angry enough to skittle the Aussies in 1981, they are all revealed in depth in Botham's Book of the Ashes .",

Arun Maira, one of India\u2019s leading business consultants and thinkers, applies the principles of `scenario thinking` and the `learning field` to identify some key obstacles to India`s holistic growth.Deftly weaving memoir with history, this book discusses India`s journey from its birth as a nation, to its more recent liberalized phase. The author examines a broad canvas of concerns, and emphasizes that unless India`s growth percolates to its poor and underprivileged we will have a divided and unequal society and nation. He highlights some key steps that are needed to put India on the appropriate growth trajectory. He stresses that businesses must look beyond profits and emphasizes the critical need for collaboration between business and government for nation building, and, presents a conceptual roadmap for India`s future, suited to its diverse social, economic and cultural needs.",

        "description": "Life should be simple for Cassie. For the small population of Earth survivors who live on the Space Station Hope everything they do is planned and scheduled, down to the cyclical food menus, their roles in the station, even how many children they have. Despite rigid controls directing her life, Cassie feels more out of synch than ever and worries she won\u2019t find a place for herself within the station community. Perhaps that\u2019s because she\u2019s hearing things inside her head that can\u2019t possibly be real. Or maybe it\u2019s the regular elopements of her peers, heading off to a romantic future in the Married Quarter of the space station, whilst she\u2019s never even been attracted to a boy \u2013 no matter how hard her best friend Ami pushes them at her. Then there are the odd questions her work placement partner Balik keeps raising. His questions are just as troubling for her as his distracting smiles and eyes that seem to see inside her.As Cassie draws closer to Balik she finds that everything else in her life begins to shift. He tells her things that call into question the system they live within. She can't believe he is right, but at the same time she finds it hard to deny the sincerity of his ideas. Could there be a connection between Cassie\u2019s problems and Balik\u2019s questions? The truth will drag them both to a terrifying and deadly conclusion beyond anything they could have imagined.",

        "description": "From the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal best-selling author of The Alpha Group comes a new romance about the devastating power of guilt and two people\u2019s struggle to overcome their pasts.Hope is a dangerous thing. I know that more than most. Everything good I've ever had has been stolen from me \u2014 my friends, my fianc\u00e9, my innocence, some would say even my sanity. All I have left is the cage. Fighting is the only thing that eases the ache inside me even a little. It\u2019s the only thing that keeps the bottle at bay.I was content to ride out my life alone. I was done dreaming that things could be better. But then I met Grace, and from that moment, all I could do was dream.She's battling those same demons, only she's losing. I don\u2019t want to care, but something about her calls to me. That pain in her eyes is so sharp, so familiar. I know it\u2019s only a matter of time before it pulls her below the surface.I can help her, and maybe, just maybe, she can help me too. For the first time in what feels like forever, I've got hope, and that scares the hell out of me.This book is told from dual perspectives, so both Grace and Logan get their say. It is a full length (300 page) novel withno cliffhanger. There is likely to be a sequel, but the story can be enjoyed alone.Not suitable for younger readers. This is an intense story that deals with issues of alcoholism and military PTSD, and it contains adult content.",

Narrated in Walser's inimitable, playful language, these theatrical pieces overturn traditional notions of the fairy tale, transforming the Brothers Grimm into metatheater, even metareflections.Snow White forgives the evil queen for trying to kill her, Cinderella doubts her prince and enjoys being hated by her evil stepsisters; the Fairy Tale itself is a character who encourages her to stay within the confines of the story. Sleeping Beauty, the royal family, and its retainers are not happy about being woken from their sleep by an absurd, unpretentious, Walser-like hero. Mary and Joseph are taken aback by what lies in store for their baby Jesus.",

        "description": "The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duckis an original classic by Beatrix Potter.Poor Jemima. All she wants to do is lay her eggs in peace, and be allowed to hatch them herself. At last she flies off and finds the perfect place. Little does the silly duck realise that the charming gentleman who has lent her his woodshed is busily planning a delicious meal of . . . roast duck!Jemima was a real duck belonging to Beatrix Potter, who lived at her farm, Hill Top. The story also features Beatrix's own sheepdog, Kep, who thankfully manages to save Jemima from a nasty fate!Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book,The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten.Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.Today Beatrix Potter's original 23 tales are still published by Frederick Warne, alongside a wide range of other formats including baby books, activity books and gift and sound books.The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duckis number nine in Beatrix Potter's series of 23 little books. Look out for the rest!1 The Tale of Peter Rabbit2 The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin3 The Tailor of Gloucester4 The Tale of Benjamin Bunny5 The Tale of Two Bad Mice6 The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle7 The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher8 The Tale of Tom Kitten9 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck10 The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies11 The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse12 The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes13 The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse14 The Tale of Mr. Tod15 The Tale of Pigling Bland16 The Tale of Samuel Whiskers17 The Tale of The Pie and the Patty-Pan18 The Tale of Ginger and Pickles19 The Tale of Little Pig Robinson20 The Story of a Fierce Bad Rabbit21 The Story of Miss Moppet22 Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes23 Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes",

Her two best friends, Max, an endlessly scheming personal trainer, and Libby, a jobless bombshell, would like to get their hands on William...but he's only interested in Kas, an editorial assistant at a struggling New York literary agency who thinks William is out of her league. The two have a fling, and Kas returns home to New York wondering if she'll hear from William again. So when he finally sends an email, she's delighted. Until she opens it. The email is not quite the love missive Kas expected. Did she misjudge William? A miscommunication ensues, triggering a rapid-fire series of comic developments that, within days, bring William to New York, now under the impression that Kas has offered him a place to live. As he unveils his big plan to take Manhattan by storm and make his fortune, Kas finally recognizes how limited William's intellectual capabilities He makes Kevin Federline look like Albert Einstein. Readers are along for the outrageous ride as Kas copes with her new roommate's eccentricities, including a preoccupation with the Psychic Friends Network and a passion for collecting Big Apple-themed souvenirs, and the realization that her dream man is a comic nightmare.\"Elaine Szewczyk is smart and funny, and knows that New York bars and African safaris have something important in When it comes to dating, it's a jungle out there. If you savor Sophie Kinsella or Lauren Weisberger, you'll want to add her to your reading list.\"---Chris Bohjalian, author of MIDWIVES, THE DOUBLE BIND, and SKELETONS AT THE FEAST\"Spirited, irreverent, bilious, and above all funny, Elaine Szewczyk's bitter cocktail provides a much-needed antidote for the chick-lit genre...\"---Adam Langer, author of Ellington Boulevard, Crossing California, and The Washington Story",

Steep-banked, fast-moving, it offers the promise of fine fishing, and of something more, a possibility too fantastic to be true. When Abe and Dan, two widowers who have found solace in each other's company and a shared passion for fishing, hear rumors of the Creek, and what might be found there, the remedy to both their losses, they dismiss it as just another fish story. Soon, though, the men find themselves drawn into a tale as deep and old as the Reservoir. It's a tale of dark pacts, of long-buried secrets, and of a mysterious figure known as Der Fisher: the Fisherman. It will bring Abe and Dan face to face with all that they have lost, and with the price they must pay to regain it.",

He ultimately escaped the death and drugs of a crime-riddled Bronx by way of the United States Marine Corps. However, after earning his way into the esteemed ranks of the service's famed Scout Snipers, Delgado saw that old struggle reignited when he was dumped into the hell of war in Iraq.There Delgado proved not only a participant, but a warrior capable of turning the tide in several of the most harrowing and historically important battles of the evolving war. He took all the hard lessons learned in combat and, as MARSOC's original lead sniper instructor, made himself a pivotal figure in revolutionizing the way special operations snipers trained and operated. But even after accomplishing his mission in the military, Delgado still faced that original fight, struggling to understand and accept the man his experiences had transformed him into.",

        "description": "A New Yorker writer revisits the seminal book of her youth--Middlemarch--and fashions a singular, involving story of how a passionate attachment to a great work of literature can shape our lives and help us to read our own histories.Rebecca Mead was a young woman in an English coastal town when she first read George Eliot's Middlemarch, regarded by many as the greatest English novel. After gaining admission to Oxford, and moving to the United States to become a journalist, through several love affairs, then marriage and family, Mead read and reread Middlemarch. The novel, which Virginia Woolf famously described as \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people,\" offered Mead something that modern life and literature did not.In this wise and revealing work of biography, reporting, and memoir, Rebecca Mead leads us into the life that the book made for her, as well as the many lives the novel has led since it was written. Employing a structure that deftly mirrors that of the novel, My Life in Middlemarch takes the themes of Eliot's masterpiece--the complexity of love, the meaning of marriage, the foundations of morality, and the drama of aspiration and failure--and brings them into our world. Offering both a fascinating reading of Eliot's biography and an exploration of the way aspects of Mead's life uncannily echo that of Eliot herself, My Life in Middlemarch is for every ardent lover of literature who cares about why we read books, and how they read us.",

        "description": "\"Poetic, down trodden and nihilistic, Jonathan Ashley treads through parts of the human psyche that others fear for one black tar mind-fuck-ride of a novel.\"- Frank Bill, author of CRIMES IN SOUTHERN INDIANA and DONNYBROOKIn Jonathan Ashley's dark humor debut crime novel, a Louisville bookstore owner leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money.Jon Catlett, a misanthropic literary obsessive, is facing the loss of the only thing in the world he loves; his used bookstore, a haven for fellow weirdos, outcasts, misunderstood geniuses and malcontents. Jon has several other problems, the least of which are his love affair with a bi-polar femme fatale heiress to a thriving northern steel company or the exponentially growing opiate habit he has developed.When Jon, during a deal gone wrong, accidentally kills a fellow drug addict, getting away with murder turns out to be the least of his worries. The steps he and Paul, the obsessive-compulsive manager of Jon's store, must take to cover up the killing result in the two cornering Louisville\u2019s blossoming heroin trade.From West End gangbangers to dirty cops and crusading narcotics detectives, Jon and his unstable partner in crime must dilute their morals and thicken their skin if they are to have any hope of surviving the lucrative but deadly life they've stumbled upon.MORE PRAISE FOR THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS:\"Ashley breaks our hearts, he breaks all the rules and, most importantly, he breaks our expectations of what a simple crime story can be. He shatters it, in fact, leaving readers craving another deadly taste\u2014much like the lost souls in this chilling, amazing story.\"- Patrick Wensink, author of BROKEN PIANO FOR PRESIDENT\"We live in a capitalistic society, yes, but nobody said doing business is easy or even enjoyable. Jonathan Ashley makes this point quite well in The Cost of Doing Business. Of course when the business is the heroin trade, the stakes are life and death, but is the suspicion, the betrayal, the plotting and scheming, all that different than what goes on in the corporate world? Louisville bookstore owner Jon Catlett leaves his used volumes of Yeats behind to get into the drug trade and make some real money, and the result is blood-filled mayhem. He never loses his sense of literate irony, though, taking us through a fast, unpredictable novel with equal parts darkness and humor. A very confident debut.\"- Scott Adlerberg, author of SPIDERS AND FLIES\"...poetic observations worthy of Daniel Woodrell or Matthew McBride\"- January Magazine",

Las cartas del Tarot constituyen una manera interesante de resolver esa ansiedad humana atemporal que jam\u00e1s ces\u00f3 por conocer el futuro, y al mismo tiempo pueden simbolizarnos un profundo viaje al interior de nosotros mismos si las empleamos de modo terap\u00e9utico. Pero, \u00bfrealmente predicen algo las cartas o es una condici\u00f3n especial de ciertas personas que ofician de int\u00e9rpretes de este or\u00e1culo?Esta es una discusi\u00f3n posiblemente tan vieja como la historia misma del Tarot. En esta obra, no obstante, nos ocuparemos de su significado psicol\u00f3gico \u2013si es posible encontrarle alguno- a trav\u00e9s de un abordaje arquetipal que, bien utilizado, puede ser terap\u00e9utico. Por ende, una herramienta nada despreciable y portadora de una riqu\u00edsima simbolog\u00eda, de la que echar mano en la consultor\u00eda transpersonal.Cartas redondas, cuadradas, rectangulares. Tarot digital, informatizado, aplicaciones para celulares, tablets e innumerables dispositivos tecnol\u00f3gicos. Con el nuevo milenio este legendario arte sigue cautivando a personas de remotos confines y muy inconexos entre s\u00ed. No pierde su magia, y se han escrito cientos de tratados y estudios tanto esot\u00e9ricos como psicosociol\u00f3gicos sobre \u00e9l. Y posiblemente seguir\u00e1 cautivando a los seres humanos mucho tiempo m\u00e1s.",

        "description": "When Oliver Sacks was twelve years old, a perceptive schoolmaster wrote in his 'Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far'. It is now abundantly clear that Sacks has never stopped going . . .From its opening pages on his youthful obsession with motorcycles and speed, On the Move is infused with his restless energy. As he recounts his experiences as a young neurologist in the early 1960s, first in California and then in New York, where he discovered a long-forgotten illness in the back wards of a chronic hospital, as well as with a group of patients who would define his life, it becomes clear that Sacks's earnest desire for engagement has occasioned unexpected encounters and travels \u2013 sending him through bars and alleys, over oceans, and across continents.With unbridled honesty and humour, Sacks shows us that the same energy that drives his physical passions \u2013bodybuilding, weightlifting, and swimming \u2013 also drives his cerebral passions. He writes about his love affairs, both romantic and intellectual, his guilt over leaving his family to come to America, his bond with his schizophrenic brother, and the writers and scientists \u2013 Thom Gunn, A. R. Luria, W. H. Auden, Gerald M. Edelman, Francis Crick \u2013 who influenced him.On the Move is the story of a brilliantly unconventional physician and writer \u2013 and of the man who has illuminated the many ways that the brain makes us human.",

This essential tome includes three stories of battle written by Ennis and illustrated by Tomas Aira including: Castles in the Sky: A horrifying tale of early bomber pilots and their incredibly difficult missions during wartime. Thrust into the sky with a new team of soldiers these brave men learn quickly the horrors of aerial combat over the skies of Germany. Children of Israel: In 1973, the Golan Heights was the home to the most brutal tank warfare in history. As a young nation of Israel faced the imposing forces of the Syrian army, the true mettle of these soldiers would be tested as never before. The Last German Winter: February 1945: as the Soviet war machine crashes into eastern Germany on a tidal wave of carnage and revenge, a mother and her children join the flood of refugees struggling to stay ahead of the invaders. But the realities of battle are dreadful to behold, and what the little family find waiting for them is deadlier than any mythical dragon. Worse still, the strange figures who appear from the deep woods are far from being knights in shining armour- and in these dark times, the price of salvation may just be too much to bear. This volume collects War Stories #1 - 9 of the ongoing comic book series.\"",

        "description": "The vampire that rebooted the genre is back with a second helping of supernatural snark, and this time he has even more truth to tell about the challenges faced by a paranormal dude just trying to have a normal life.So...yeah. It's me again. America's most sarcastic vampire. I'm back on the blog. It's been a while - about a year, if we need to get into specifics. Which I usually do. It's just a thing with me. A lot has happened since we last chatted - some good, some bad. All worthwhile, in the grand scheme. I've dealt with the whole Living Dead thing long enough now to know how to keep it from taking over my life. What I'm still figuring out is how to keep it from wreaking havoc on everyone else's lives. It's a roller coaster, for sure, but I'm convinced that waiting for me somewhere on the other side of the Other Side is a real-life life, not just some artificially-sweetened half-life substitute. I want a family. I want my music. I want the dream come true, not the dream fell through. And I'm determined to have it, regardless of how eternal this afterlife thing might be. But it's a hell of a lot to keep track of. Barring any unforeseen developments that might undo all my vampirosity, I may have to grow up a little in order to get it all to work out. I'm ready for that, though. As fun as it might seem to hang with the Lost Boys, I can't be Peter Pan-pire forever.What readers are\"...if you liked Joe Vampire, you'll love The Afterlife. It's everything you loved about the first book made better.\" \"I really enjoyed reading the first Joe Vampire book, but this second installment was an order of magnitude even more fun to read. It was just the perfect combination of sharp humor, unexpected allusions, and zany metaphors.\" \"...wait until you read what happens to Hube. My heart was racing, and I could not stop reading until I knew every last detail.\"",

        "description": "Close your eyes and think of a phrase that describes the most horrible act that you can imagine. Search for that phrase on the internet, and a website called Amity will be in the top of the list. The regulars at Amity can help you learn about that horrible thing. If you desire, can help you find it. Or help you do it.Reclusive neckbeard Timothy Berbee has exiled himself from the world, and spends his time to huddled with the reckless population of Amity. When they turn their collective poison on him, his life turns into a battle to reconnect with his lost humanity, and a race against his own apathy to save the life of a stranger.In a satirical whirlwind story based on real-world events, AMITY explores the allure of online lives and the downward spiral when absolute anonymity overrides one's moral compass.",

        "description": "Garth Ennis visionary series reaches deep into the recesses of history and finds the most spine chilling tales of conflict and war throughout the modern era. This new volume delivers powerful stories that illustrate the horror and humanity within the violence and misery. In this vital tome are two stories written by Ennis and illustrated by Thomas Aria including: Our Wild Geese Go: \"T'was England bade our wild geese go, that small nations would be free...\" In the Second World War, any Irishman wanting to fight the Nazis had to join the British army- the Republic of Ireland having declared neutrality when the war began. Now, a small unit of Irish soldiers join the advance into Germany- where the going is rough and the enemy nowhere near surrender. And old tensions remain from Ireland's own struggle for independence, as well as the bloody civil war that followed. The Tokyo Club: How do you join The Tokyo Club? Simple. You climb into your single seat, single engine fighter- loaded with fuel and ammunition- and fly 700 miles across the open Pacific until you reach the mainland of Japan. There you fight off any enemy aircraft attempting to hit the American bombers you're escorting to their targets. Still alive? Now comes the fun part. You fly another 700 miles back home to your airstrip on Iwo Jima, fuel running lower and lower, nothing but ocean for miles around. Any battle damage you've suffered will reduce your chances even further. Make it back and you're in the club. And more good news: you get to do it all again tomorrow. This volume collects War Stories #10 - 15 of the ongoing comic book series.\"",

Now, she doesn\u2019t have much of a plan at all: living at home, working as a performing mermaid at a second-rate water park, distracting herself with one boy after another.That changes the day she meets Leigh. Disillusioned with small-town life and looking for something greater, Leigh is not a \u201cnice girl.\u201d She is unlike anyone Vanni has met, and a friend when Vanni desperately needs one.

She was a beauty that was by far different than the project chicks that Zaire was used to dealing with. Being the beast that he was, Zaire was definitely in need of a \"Beautee\" to tame his wild side.Beautee knew that meeting Zaire was no accident. She was intentionally placed in his path with an agenda. She knew that not many men could resist her beauty or her booty. As an undercover FBI agent, Beautee was out to gain freedom for her husband, who had been set up by Zaire and wrongly accused of murder. It had taken Beautee years, but she now had enough evidence on Zaire to put him behind bars and free the only man that she ever loved - her husband. Zaire\u2019s mission to control the city clouded his thoughts and friends became enemies. Family members went missing and bodies are found throughout the city.A hood tale of love, loyalty, murder and deception leaves you realizing that everything ain't always what it seems.",

But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting-- he's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It's ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd-- whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself-- Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.",

        "description": "Dennis Milam Bensie is One Gay American. Born in the 1960s and raised with traditional values in Robinson, Illinois, Bensie desperately wanted romance, a beautiful wedding, and a baby to carry on the family name. He denied his sexuality and married a woman at nineteen years old, but fantasized of weddings where he could be the bride. The newlyweds \"adopted\" a Cabbage Patch Doll and ironically witnessed a Cabbage Patch Doll wedding (a successful fundraiser staged by a local women's club) where the dolls were granted the type of grand ceremony off-limits to gay couples. In search of his identity as a gay man, Bensie divorced his wife and stumbled through missteps and lessons that still sting his generation: defending against bullies, \"disappointing\" his parents, and looking for love in gay bars, bath houses and restrooms. He helped his straight friends plan their dream weddings and mourned his gay friends dying of AIDS. Although true love has not yet come his way, Bensie has learned to love himself. Bensie is the author of the much-lauded memoir, Shorn: Toys to Men, which recounts his battle with paraphilia. One Gay American tells the rest of his story and draws parallels to gay history, decade by decade, with newspaper headlines and quotations. Bensie is the gay neighbor that you either love or hate. Either way, he's got a lot to say and says it with no apologies.",

        "description": "La corte del re Luigi XVI sta per essere travolta dallo scandalo del secolo, passato alla storia come \"l'affare della collana\". L'intrigo, ordito da una nobildonna decaduta, assetata di denaro e bramosa di scalare i vertici dell'alta societ\u00e0 parigina e di avere un ruolo a corte, coinvolge nelle sue trame l'ambizioso cardinale Rohan, il sedicente mago e alchimista Cagliostro, fidatissimo amico dell'alto prelato, e la stessa regina Maria Antonietta, spianando la strada alla Rivoluzione dell'89. L'affare della collana non resta confinato fra le mura dei tribunali, ma diventa subito di pubblico dominio. Le arringhe degli avvocati vanno a ruba come bestseller, molti scrittori si arricchiscono con pamphlet scandalistici venduti in migliaia di copie. La Francia si appassiona alla vicenda e si divide fra innocentisti e colpevolisti. Ma il debole re Luigi non ne coglie appieno la portata e lascia che le cose seguano il loro corso, accelerando cos\u00ec il tramonto e la fine della monarchia francese.",

Will the cursed ax destroy her? Or will she be given a way out?This short story is the first by AJ Coonley that is NOT a part of his 'Unforeseen Circumstances' series. It is not a typical horror story. There is a ghost, but his bark is worse than his bite. AJ hates to admit it, but this is closer to being a romance than a horror story.As with all AJ's stories, \"The Executioner's Ax\" is Perma-Free for Kindle Unlimited (KU) and Prime subscribers.",

        "description": "Just when you thought it was safe to eat a hamburger again, Robin Cook--master of medical mysteries, deadly epidemics, and creepy comas--returns with an all too likely villain drawn right from current headlines: the American meat industry. If you've ever wondered where the E. coli bacteria comes from, and exactly how it can ravage the human body, destroying everything in its path, this is the book for you. As usual, Cook delivers solid information, well-researched medical arcana, and a scathing indictment of managed health care.His protagonist, Kim Regis, is an all-too-typical ego-driven surgeon, whose arrogance and invulnerability set him up to be brought low by the deadly toxin that takes the life of his young daughter. Sparing no time and barely a paragraph to reflect on his loss, Regis goes right after the culprit, a meat-packing behemoth that brings dead and diseased animals to the slaughterhouse, breaking every health regulation in the book. The scenes set on the killing floor and in the boning rooms will make a vegetarian out of the most confirmed red-meat eater.Toxinis a heart-pounding thriller that hits very close to home.--Jane Adams",

For more than a decade, the group tore through the charts and indulged in an endless cycle of drugs, women, and violence, until two musicians died--the drummer by drugs, the guitarist by a crazed gunman. Once the band was finished, lead singer Tristam Scarr retreated to the English countryside, hiding from the world until the day he hires an American to ghostwrite his memoirs. Stewart Hoag arrives in London in the company of Lulu, his ever-hungry basset hound, to find the rock idol of his youth reduced to a wheezing, frail fortysomething. The first thing Starr tells him is that their drummer never overdosed--he was murdered. And as their interviews progress, Hoagy learns that working for a rock star is almost as dangerous as being one.",

        "description": "\"Plan of Attack\" is a definitive account of how & why President Geo W. Bush, his war council & allies launched a preemptive attack to topple Saddam Hussein & occupy Iraq. Woodward's latest account of Washington decisionmaking provides an original, authoritative narrative of behind-the-scenes maneuvering over two years, examining the causes & consequences of the most controversial war since Vietnam. Based on interviews with 75 key participants & over 3.5 hours of exclusive interviews with Bush, Plan of Attack is part presidential history charting the decisions made during 16 critical months; part military history revealing precise details & the evolution of the Top Secret war planning under the restricted codeword Polo Step; part a spy story as the CIA dispatches a covert paramilitary team into northern Iraq 6 months before the start of the war. This team recruited 87 Iraqi spies designated with the cryptonym DB/ROCKSTARS, one of whom turned over the personnel files of all 6000 men in Saddam Hussein's personal security organization. What emerges are astonishingly intimate portraits: Bush in war cabinet meetings in the White House Situation Room & Oval Office, & in private conversation; Dick Cheney, the focused & driven vice president; Colin Powell, the conflicted & cautious secretary of state; Donald Rumsfeld, the controlling war technocrat; Geo Tenet, the activist CIA director; Tommy Franks, the profane & demanding general; Condoleezza Rice, the ever-present referee & national security adviser; Karl Rove, the hands-on political strategist; other key members of the White House staff & congressional leadership; & foreign leaders ranging from British Prime Minister Blair to Russian President Putin. Plan of Attack provides new details on the intelligence assessments of Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction & the planning for the war's aftermath.",

Dealing with the subjects of domestic psychological, physical and sexual abuse and the lasting damage these do to their victims, it covers twelve years in the lives of two initially unconnected girls, Emma and Helen, both the victims of some form of abuse and the very different consequences this abuse has to both their lives.There are some dark and tragic moments as Emma stumbles from one emotional or physical disaster to the next from the ages of sixteen to twenty-eight. Ultimately it is the realisation of all her clich\u00e9d romantic dreams which provides her with the trigger she desperately needs to enable her to take control of her own life. It makes her realise the only way to no longer be a victim is to stop relying on others for emotional and physical stability and to stand on her own two feet. It gives her the courage to face her fears and to do what is right for her daughter.Helen, on the other hand, uses abuse as a weapon with which to defend herself from a world she can not understand. In reality the abuse she has suffered is difficult to define and the line between legitimate psychological damage and inbuilt character traits is blurred.The two girls lives come together with devastating effects.",

        "description": "Minneapolis detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth are bored\u2014ever since they solved the Monkeewrench case, the Twin Cities have been in a murder-free dry spell, as people no longer seem interested in killing one another. But when elderly Morey Gilbert is found dead in the plant nursery he runs with his wife, Lily, the crime drought ends\u2014not with a trickle, but with a torrent. Who would kill Morey, a man without an enemy, a man who might as well have been a saint? His tiny, cranky little wife is no help, and may even be a suspect; his estranged son, Jack, an infamous ambulance-chasing lawyer, has his own enemies; and his son-in-law, former cop Marty Pullman, is so depressed over his wife's death a year earlier he's ready to kill himself, but not Morey. The number of victims\u2014all elderly\u2014grows, and the city is fearful once again. Can Grace McBride's cold case-solving software program somehow find the missing link?",

        "description": "Robles Mart\u00ednez fue un escritor de mediano prestigio. Si bien no pertenec\u00eda a las ligas mayores de la literatura, estaba muy cerca del reconocimiento masivo que supon\u00eda su obra. La cr\u00edtica m\u00e1s exigente lo rese\u00f1aba como una futura promesa. Los comentaristas dominicales de libros siempre parec\u00edan estar a punto de considerarlo como un escritor que no necesitaba tarjetas de presentaci\u00f3n en el extranjero: su firma y sus premios lo avalaban. Sin embargo, en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, un oscuro haz de luz pareci\u00f3 entorpecer su calidad de escritura. Los cr\u00edticos se\u00f1alaban que se hab\u00eda convertido en un mero escritor deseoso de superventas, perge\u00f1ando novelas simples y facilonas que jam\u00e1s podr\u00edan igualarlo a sus admirados Faulkner y Joyce. De forma sorpresiva, la prensa especializada dec\u00eda que sus libros era un conjunto de acartonados personajes que segu\u00edan las l\u00edneas convencionales del realismo puro y duro.\"El secuestro de Robles Mart\u00ednez\" son dos novelas cortas agrupadas en un crimen, \"El mayordomo\" describe el modus operandi de una agrupaci\u00f3n de la alta sociedad herm\u00e9tica cuyos fines son desconocidos inclusive para el m\u00e1s leal de sus miembros, mientras que \"El diario\" es un palimpsesto del escritor secuestrado donde hace un an\u00e1lisis cr\u00edtico de sus or\u00edgenes y su porvenir. Dicha publicaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 emparentada al cyberpunk y la novela negra, rompiendo a su vez todas las reglas pre-establecidas en dichos estilos literarios.",

And now Constance Langton has inherited this dark place as well as the mysteries surrounding it. Having grown up in a house marked by the death of her sister, Constance is no stranger to mystery, secrets, and the dark magic around us. Her father was distant. Her mother was in perpetual mourning for her lost child. In a desperate attempt to coax her mother back to health, Constance took her to a seance hoping she would find supernatural comfort. But tragic consequences followed, leaving her alone in the world-- alone with Wraxford Hall. Saddled with this questionable bequest, she must find the truth at the heart of all these disappearances, apparitions, betrayal, blackmail, and villainy, even if it costs her life. John Harwood's second novel delivers on the great promise proven by his first with this gripping mystery set in the heart of Victorian England.",

        "description": "From bestselling author Jon Krakauer, a stark, powerful, meticulously reported narrative about a series of sexual assaults at the University of Montana \u00ad\u2014 stories that illuminate the human drama behind the national plague of campus rapeMissoula, Montana, is a typical college town, with a highly regarded state university, bucolic surroundings, a lively social scene, and an excellent football team\u2014the Grizzlies\u2014with a rabid fan base. \u00a0The Department of Justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the Missoula police between January 2008 and May 2012. Few of these assaults were properly handled by either the university or local authorities.\u00a0In this, Missoula is also typical. \u00a0A DOJ report released in December of 2014 estimates 110,000 women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four are raped each year.\u00a0Krakauer\u2019s devastating narrative of what happened in Missoula makes clear why rape is so prevalent on American campuses, and why rape victims are so reluctant to report assault. \u00a0Acquaintance rape is a crime like no other. Unlike burglary or embezzlement or any other felony, the victim often comes under more suspicion than the alleged perpetrator. This is especially true if the victim is sexually active; if she had been drinking prior to the assault \u2014 and if the man she accuses plays on a popular sports team. The vanishingly small but highly publicized incidents of false accusations are often used to dismiss her claims in the press. If the case goes to trial, the woman\u2019s entire personal life becomes fair game for defense attorneys. \u00a0This brutal reality goes a long way towards explaining why acquaintance rape is the most underreported crime in America. In addition to physical trauma, its victims often suffer devastating psychological damage that leads to feelings of shame, emotional paralysis and stigmatization. PTSD rates for rape victims are estimated to be 50%, higher than soldiers returning from war.\u00a0In Missoula, Krakauer chronicles the searing experiences of several women in Missoula \u2014 the nights when they were raped; their fear and self-doubt in the aftermath; the way they were treated by the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys; the public vilification and private anguish; their bravery in pushing forward and what it cost them.\u00a0Some of them went to the police. Some declined to go to the police, or to press charges, but sought redress from the university, which has its own, non-criminal judicial process when a student is accused of rape. In two cases the police agreed to press charges and the district attorney agreed to prosecute. One case led to a conviction; one to an acquittal. Those women courageous enough to press charges or to speak publicly about their experiences were attacked in the media, on Grizzly football fan sites, and/or to their faces. The university expelled three of the accused rapists, but one was reinstated by state officials in a secret proceeding. One district attorney testified for an alleged rapist at his university hearing. She later left the prosecutor\u2019s office and successfully defended the Grizzlies\u2019 star quarterback in his rape trial. The horror of being raped, in each woman\u2019s case, was magnified by the mechanics of the justice system and the reaction of the community.\u00a0Krakauer\u2019s dispassionate, carefully documented account of what these women endured cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape. College-age women are not raped because they are promiscuous, or drunk, or send mixed signals, or feel guilty about casual sex, or seek attention.",

In it, Kant illuminates the basic concept that is central to his moral philosophy and, in fact, to the entire field of modern ethical thought: the Categorical Imperative, the supreme principle of morality, stating that all decisions should be made based on what is universally acceptable. Featuring the renowned translation and commentary of Oxford's H. J. Paton, this volume has long been considered the definitive English edition of Kant's classic text. Kant'sGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, Paton writes in his preface, is one of the small books which is truly great: it has exercised on human thought an influence almost ludicrously disproportionate to its size.",

        "description": "The fascinating letters of Galileo's eldest daughter to her fatherPlaced in a convent at the age of thirteen, Virginia Galilei, Galileo\u2019s eldest daughter, wrote to her father continually. Now Dava Sobel has translated into English all 124 surviving letters that Virginia (renamed Suor Maria Celeste at the convent) wrote to Galileo. The letters span a dramatic decade that included the Thirty Years\u2019 War, the bubonic plague, and the development of Galileo\u2019s own universe-changing discoveries. Suor Maria Celeste\u2019s letters touch on these events, but mostly they focus on details of everyday life that connect her and her father: descriptions of confections she sent to him; news of his estate, which she managed while he was on trial; a request for Galileo to fix the convent clock. Her prose reveals an exceptional woman and presents a memorable portrait of deep affection between a father and daughter.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Successfully ensconced at a famous salon on Madison Avenue, he now wants to see his lover get ahead. The problem is, gorgeous Ricky Hart has strayed from building on past achievements as an actor. He's lost touch with his passion to build a career as a Broadway performer and now works as a bartender. Stuck in a rut of sleeping all day after partying all night, he's ceased going to classes and auditions; even his agent has abandoned interest in helping him. While Bobby means well, his attempt to jolt Ricky into action by pointing out this backward slide only serves as a wedge in their relationship. One of Bobby's biggest clients, however, is a powerful casting director, and Bobby promises Ricky the opportunity to show the woman his talent. Now, Ricky must dig down into his soul and sharpen the edge he's lost over the past year. It's up to him to avoid liquor and his wayward buddies devoid of ambition. He, alone, can discipline himself to study his craft and get back in shape for a career that depends on it. As Ricky prepares for the rigors of auditioning, Bobby receives inside information about a major production of Hair being cast. As it happens, Ricky has dreamed of playing one of the lead roles in that show for more than half his life! He focuses as he never has before, and prepares with diligence to win the part. Loyal to the man he adores, Bobby chooses to put aside his own needs while awaiting the outcome of Ricky's efforts. But will his love and encouragement be enough to help Ricky rekindle his passion for performing and gain the important role?

The American Prospect 's James K.

As the influential Harvard Business School newsletter put it, Shulman \"specifically outlines how structural changes in the economy may be achieved, thus expanding opportunities for all Americans.\" This edition includes a new afterword that intervenes in the post-election debate by arguing that low-wage work is an urgent moral issue of our time.",

Born into a clan of lumberjacks, ranchers, and frontier lawyers, David Samuel Peckinpah served in the Marines and then made his way to Hollywood, where he worked on a string of low-budget features before being hired as a writer for Gunsmoke in 1955. Quickly becoming the hottest writer in television, Peckinpah went on to direct a phenomenal series of features, including Ride the High Country, Straw Dogs, The Getaway, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and The Wild Bunch. The life he led -- glamorous, wild, and beset by personal demons -- is as vivid as his films. A hopeless romantic and a grim nihilist, inspiration to such luminaries as DePalma, Scorsese, and Tarantino, Sam Peckinpah was an audacious American original. If They Move...Kill 'Em! is his wild and woolly story.",

While a small group of people staunchly adored them, most Americans were not as fond of the vegetables formerly known as \"cruciferous\" (who doesn't remember a plate of stinky boiled cabbage or President Bush's condemnation of broccoli?). But in recent years, a transformation has occurred. Kale has taken the world by storm and there's hardly a restaurant left that doesn't have cauliflower on the menu. The rising popularity of brassicas is not only due to their extraordinary health benefits and \"superfood\" status, but also the realization that they can taste delicious when properly prepared. Brassicas shows home cooks how to bring out the flavors of these vegetables without death-by-boiling or burial under a blanket of cheese. When roasted, Brussels sprouts reveal an inherent sweetness. Watercress and arugula add a delightful peppery punch to salads. Caramelizing cauliflower in the saut\u00e9 pan brings out its best attributes. Celebrating natural flavors rather than masking them, Brassicas both inspires cooks as well as arms them with appetizing new ways to increase their vegetable consumption.",

        "description": "It is the ancient days of the Persian Empire. Hadassah was content in her quiet life in the Jewish quarter of the city of Babylon with her uncle Mordecai, who had raised her from childhood. But she was old enough to be married, and yet her uncle hadn't arranged a marriage for her. Meanwhile in Shushan, King Ahasuerus' marriage to the vain and selfish Vashti has ended, and a new wife must be found. Why not bring to him the most beautiful women of the kingdom, and let him choose? And so the loveliest young women of the empire are selected in local contests, and Hadassah is among those chosen to go to Shushan to meet the King. But as a Jewess in a foreign land with powerful enemies to her faith, she must conceal her true identity and take the Babylonian name of Esther. Will she find love with a man she has never met? And can she survive in a strict royal court controlled by the evil prime minister Haman, who wants to destroy her people? Out of print for 40 years, this special edition contains the original text of \"Behold Your Queen!\" in a large, trade size paperback, suitable for collecting.",

        "description": "If we could turn back the clock psychologically, could we also turn it back physically? For more than thirty years, award-winning social psychologist Ellen Langer has studied this provocative question, and now, in Counterclockwise, she presents the answer: Opening our minds to what\u2019s possible, instead of presuming impossibility, can lead to better health\u2013at any age.Drawing on landmark work in the field and her own body of colorful and highly original experiments\u2013including the first detailed discussion of her \u201ccounterclockwise\u201d study, in which elderly men lived for a week as though it was 1959 and showed dramatic improvements in their hearing, memory, dexterity, appetite, and general well-being\u2013Langer shows that the magic of rejuvenation and ongoing good health lies in being aware of the ways we mindlessly react to social and cultural cues. Examining the hidden decisions and vocabulary that shape the medical world (\u201cchronic\u201d versus \u201cacute,\u201d \u201ccure\u201d versus \u201cremission\u201d), the powerful physical effects of placebos, and the intricate but often defeatist ways we define our physical health, Langer challenges the idea that the limits we assume and impose on ourselves are real. With only subtle shifts in our thinking, in our language, and in our expectations, she tells us, we can begin to change the ingrained behaviors that sap health, optimism, and vitality from our lives. Improved vision, younger appearance, weight loss, and increased longevity are just four of the results that Langer has demonstrated.Immensely readable and riveting, Counterclockwise offers a transformative and bold new paradigm: the psychology of possibility. A hopeful and groundbreaking book by an author who has changed how people all over the world think and feel, Counterclockwise is sure to join Mindfulness as a standard source on new-century science and healing.",

        "description": "Identity movements, based on ethnicity, caste, language, religion and regional identity, have become increasingly significant in Nepal, reshaping debates on the definition of the nation, nationalism and the structure of the state. This book analyzes the rapid rise in ethnic and nationalist mobilization and conflict since 1990, the dynamics and trajectories of these movements, and their consequences for Nepal. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the book looks at the roots of mobilization and conflicts, the reasons for the increase in mobilization and violent activities, and the political and social effects of the movements. It provides a historical context for these movements and investigates how identities intersect with forms of political and economic inequality. Nepal\u2019s various identity groups - Dalits, indigenous nationalities, Madhesis and Muslims - have mobilized to different extents. By examining these diverse movements within the same time period and within a unitary state, the book illuminates which factors are more salient for the mobilization of identity groups. Bringing together empirical contributions on key issues in identity production in a comparative perspective, the book presents an interesting contribution to South Asian studies as well as studies of nationalism and identity more broadly.",

Negli ultimi anni gli studi cognitivi, le ricerche di psicologia sperimentale e le neuroscienze hanno accumulato una grande quantit\u00e0 di dati sul cervello umano, svelando meccanismi che ci erano completamente oscuri e ridisegnando le nostre conoscenze in questo campo. Cos\u00ec, a mano a mano che ci si addentra nei meandri del nostro cervello e dei suoi comportamenti, avviene che le bizzarre ricette dei guru del benessere psichico o dei sedicenti maestri del successo personale ci appaiano sempre meno plausibili e mostrino tutta la loro debolezza. Con l\u2019avanzare degli studi siamo in effetti sempre pi\u00f9 in grado di fornire un altro tipo di \u00abricette\u00bb, empiricamente fondate, che ci aiutano a tenere sotto controllo certe evidenti deviazioni di quel prodigioso organo del pensiero che non ha cessato di evolversi da milioni di anni.Per tutto questo, e altro ancora, siamo ora in grado di capire perch\u00e9 spesso ci comportiamo in modo avventato, per non dire apertamente autolesionista, senza un motivo apparente. Il cervello agisce secondo schemi adattativi com-plessi ma prevedibili, e in molte occasioni \u2013 specie nella vita dell\u2019uomo moderno \u2013 con pessimi risultati.

        "description": "Using the vivid, poignant and personal stories of the members of a website support group she founded (www.depressionfallout.com), Anne Sheffield, the author of two highly acclaimed books on depression, provides an honest record of what happens to a love relationship once depression enters the picture, and offers solid advice on what the non-depressed partner can do to improve his or her own life and the relationship.Of the millions of people who suffer from a depressive illness, few suffer in solitude. They draw the people they love - spouses, parents, children, lovers, friends - into their illness. In her first book, H\"ow You Can Survive When They're Depressed,\" Anne Sheffield coined the phrase 'depression fallout' to describe the emotional toll on the depressive's family and close friends who are unaware of their own stressful reactions and needs. She outlined the five stages of depression fallout (confusion, self-doubt, demoralisation, anger, and the need to escape) and explained that these reactions are a natural result of living with a depressed person.",

        "description": "There is nothing more devastating than the death of a loved one. And whether it comes suddenly and unexpectedly, or at the end of a long and painful illness, every death is experienced anew, a shocking loss that takes our breath away and leaves us disoriented and lost. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grief is mysterious, misunderstood, and experienced differently from individual to individual, yet there are certain universal elements. In this compassionate epistolary handbook on grief, a pastor offers comfort and understanding to a man suffering a profound loss, showing grief as a healthy process that God can use to mend broken hearts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Revised and updated, this twentieth-anniversary edition features prayers and scripture meditation, as well as a new introduction and epilogue. Simple, profound, personal, compassionate \u2026 When You Lose Someone You Love tenderly walks the grief-stricken through sorrow to peace and, eventually, renewed joy.",

Now, Spiritual Maturity: The Road to Wonderland brings those same critical lessons prefaced by quotes and illustrations from Lewis Carroll's timeless tales. Interwoven throughout the text is Christine, a fictional character, whose life and questions mirror those of today's reader. We need to be sure we are walking in the direction and in the manner God would choose. And on any journey, a map-correctly understood-can be enormously helpful. Thankfully, God has provided us one. Designed for individual and/or classroom use with study questions for each chapter.",

One of the babies died at birth and 11 days later Beth drowned the surviving twins in a bath of cold water. She was sentenced to an indefinite term of imprisonment at Broadmoor. The murder and the deep sense of shame it generated obviously affected Beth, her husband and their surviving children to an extraordinary degree, but it also resounded through the lives of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It gave rise to a collective anxiety about their family's ability to parent and an obsessive fear of hereditary insanity and depressive illness. In Sian's case, ill-suppressed knowledge of the event manifested itself in recurring nightmares and contributed to a prolonged bout of post-natal depression. After the birth of her second son, she decided to investigate the story once and for all and lay to rest the ghosts which have haunted the family for 80 years.",

Enter four unforgettable women, all friends...Lindsay, a homicide inspector in the city's police department...Claire, a medical examiner...Jill, an assistant D.A....and Cindy, a reporter who has just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle. Joining forces, pooling their talents, courage, and brains, they have one goal. To find, trap, and outwit the most diabolical and terrifying killer ever imagined.2ND CHANCE: 2ND CHANCE reconvenes the Women's Murder Club. This time, the murders of two African Americans, a little girl and an old woman, bear all the signs of a serial killer for Lindsay Boxer, newly promoted to lieutenant of San Francisco's homicide squad. But there's an odd detail she finds even more disturbing: both victims were related to city cops. A symbol glimpsed at both murder scenes leads to a racist hate group, but the taunting killer strikes again and again, leaving deliberate clues and eluding the police ever more cleverly. In the meantime, each of the women has a personal stake at risk--and the killer knows who they are.3RD DEGREE: Detective Lindsay Boxer is jogging along a beautiful San Francisco street when a fiery explosion rips through the neighborhood. A town house owned by an Internet millionaire is immediately engulfed in flames, and when Lindsay plunges inside to search for survivors, she finds three people dead. A mysterious message at the scene leaves Lindsay and the San Francisco Police Department completely baffled.Then a prominent businessman is found murdered under bizarre circumstances, with another mysterious message. Lindsay asks her friends to help her figure out who is committing these murders-and why they are intent on killing someone every three days.Even more terrifying, the killer has targeted one of the four friends who call themselves the Women's Murder Club.Which one will it be?While the investigation rages furiously, Lindsay works very closely with a federal officer assigned to the case. At the same time, she learns that one member of the Women's Murder Club is hiding a secret so dangerous and unbelievable that it could destroy them all.<!-- end main content --><!-- end main content -->",

        "description": "In Vendela Vida's taut and mesmerizing novel of ideas, a woman travels to Casablanca, Morocco, on mysterious business. While checking into her hotel, the woman is robbed of her wallet and passport - all of her money and identification. Though the police investigate, the woman senses an undercurrent of complicity between the hotel staff and the authorities - she knows she'll never recover her possessions. Stripped of her identity, she feels burdened by the crime yet strangely liberated by her sudden freedom to be anyone she chooses.A chance encounter with a movie producer leads to a job posing as a stand-in for a well-known film star. The star reels her in deeper, though, and soon she's inhabiting the actress's skin off set, too - going deeper into the Casablancan night and further from herself. And so continues a strange and breathtaking journey full of unexpected turns, an adventure in which the woman finds herself moving further and further away from the person she once was.Told with vibrant, lush detail and a wicked sense of humor, The Diver's Clothes Lie Empty is part literary mystery, part psychological thriller - an unforgettable novel that explores free will, power, and a woman's right to choose not her past, perhaps not her present, but certainly her future. This is Vendela Vida's most assured and ambitious novel yet.",

One of the men is a successful businessman who was born in France of Vietnamese parents, and who thoroughly understands and emerges himself in both the Western and the Vietnamese cultures. The other man is strictly a westerner, a Belgian, who has great responsibility and part ownership in a Belgian food production corporation, but who despises the Vietnamese culture. Both gentlemen express romantic interest in Phuong Vy, who is studying for her Master\u2019s Degree at a Belgian university. The story keeps the reader in suspense right up to the very end. Which gentlemen will Phuong ultimately choose as her partner, or will she reject both?This novel goes far beyond being a simple love story.

That's why Great Graphics on a Budget, is a must for every designer. Featuring more than 50 case studies, this book offers insights into the designers' thought processes and reveals how they have invented, discovered, and recycled innovative ways to challenge not only the budget but the client and the creative brief, too. It demonstrates that, regardless of resources, design and concept can remain strong and that a limited budget can even become a catalyst for some of the most creative designs produced.",

        "description": "The relationship between Kansas and the science of war is ingrained, consistent and evident, yet it seems antithetical to the quiet, conservative farmer who is the quintessential image of the state. It is not. The same values created both, and both created Kansas. From early exploration of America, Bleeding Kansas, the Civil War and the Plains Indian wars to the world wars and the modern era, the forts and bases of the Sunflower State have been central to America's defense. Beginning with Fort de Cavagnial in 1744 through to the defunct fields of Cold War missile silos, historians Debra Goodrich Bisel and Michelle M. Martin provide a guide to the forts and posts throughout Kansas.",

        "description": "The narrator of Anna Kim's novel 'Frozen Time' is a relatively inexperienced researcher working for the Red Cross agency that assists people from the former Yugoslavia in their search for lost relatives. As she helps a man from Kosovo whose wife disappeared during the war there, she is confronted with the gruesome results of the work of forensic archaeologists, medics and anthropologists. She is gradually drawn into the fate of her client on a more personal level and eventually accompanies him to Kosovo, where she sees the results of the conflict at first hand. --But the documentary aspect is merely the surface of the novel. Beneath it Kim explores, through her narrator, the devastating effect of loss on those left behind, their helplessness as their lives continue in 'frozen time.'The language of the novel moves from the precise, distancing objectivity of the 'ante-mortem questionnaire' ('avoid feelings, look for facts,') to a powerful and often poetic language reflecting the narrator's struggles to come to terms with her increasing personal involvement, to comprehend an experience which is so far beyond that of everyday life. In fact Kim's language often seems to be asking 'how can this be expressed in words.'This combination of fact and intense feeling makes 'Frozen Time' a moving exploration of loss, of the search for closure.",

        "description": "After the publication of his bestselling novel Catch-22, Joseph Heller usually chose to deny that any of his richly drawn characters were based on his actual war mates. However, to those who served with Heller in the 340th Bomb Group the novel's characters were indeed recognizable - the hard-drinking, vengeful, and disillusioned Chief White Half Oat, young, sliced-in-half Kid Sampson, shrieking, frenzied Hungry Joe, Colonel Cathcart, General Dreedle, Yossarian and that capitalist supreme, Milo Minderbinder.In this book, written and colorfully illustrated by the daughter of the 340th Bomb Group's commander, Colonel Willis Chapman, we finally encounter the real men and combat missions on which the novel was based. While Heller's fully developed characters stand solely, solidly and uniquely on their own merits, 'The True Story of Catch-22' proves that any resemblance to persons living or dead is, in fact, actual. This three-part book blends fact, fancy, and history with full-blown original illustrations and rare, previously unpublished photos of these daring USAAF flyers and their Corsican-based B-25 Mitchell medium bombers.Along with descriptions of the 340th's real wartime events, the work includes twelve men of the Bomb Group relating twelve richly told tales of their own. Now all of the men upon whom Heller based his characters are gone. However, the last survivor, George L. Wells, was an extraordinary combat pilot who tied the record for the number of bombing missions flown in WWII with 102.George, the model for Catch-22's Capt. Wren, is the common thread who weaves through this book, allowing the reader to truly feel the war and even thumb through George's well-worn mission book describing attacks on Axis ports, ships, bridges, and the notorious Brenner Pass.In this book the reader will discover that truth is indeed as fascinating as fiction! Author Patricia Chapman Meder has been a professional artist in both fine and commercial art for the past 35 years, 13 of them in Europe. When Catch-22 was published it was quickly apparent that this book was based on the Bomb Group her father commanded in World War II. This true-life parallel book thus begged to be written. Pat Meder has also written a full-color companion work to \"The True Story of Catch-22,\" containing her delightful original artwork and caricatures of the individuals, \"The True Story of Catch-22 Illustrated.\"REVIEWS --- Heller's satiric caricatures are here shown to have stemmed from patriotic, courageous, highly decorated airmen who daily performed heroic wartime feats against overwhelming obstacles. The log of George Wells (Captain Wren in Catch-22), who flew a record 102 missions in his B-25, is included in an appendix.Library Journal..\".uses rare and unpublished photos to bring our actual heroes to life through use of first person narrative...Fans of Catch-22 will enjoy the book. It makes good use of diaries, logs, and photos to bring the people to life.\"\"For those unfamiliar with Catch-22 the book will make you curious enough to pickup Heller's book...\" Irish Defence Forces Veterans Association",

Hampton was living her dream: flying armed helicopters in combat and commanding D Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry, the armed reconnaissance aviation squadron of the 82nd Airborne Division. An all-American girl from a small southern mill town, Kimberly was a top scholar, student body president, ROTC battalion commander, and highly ranked college tennis player. In 1998 she was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army. Then, driven by determination and ambition, Kimberly rapidly rose through the ranks in the almost all-male bastion of military aviation to command a combat aviation troop.On January 2, 2004, Captain Hampton was flying an OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter above Fallujah, Iraq, in support of a raid on an illicit weapons marketplace, searching for an illusive sniper on the rooftops of the city. A little past noon her helicopter was wracked by an explosion. A heat-seeking surface-to-air missile had gone into the exhaust and knocked off the helicopter\u2019s tail boom. The helicopter crashed, killing Kimberly.Kimberly\u2019s Flight is the story of Captain Hampton\u2019s exemplary life. This story is told through nearly fifty interviews and her own e-mails to family and friends, and is entwined with Ann Hampton\u2019s narrative of loving and losing a child.",

Nine months later and the results make for jaw-dropping reading. A cast of characters you couldn't invent do their best to impress Ms. Porter with their wit, wisdom, and physical attributes. With nicknames like the \"very clever wolf\" and the \"big bumbino,\" these would-be suitors' antics read like a modern comedy of sexual manners. Not content with looking for lust with cute guys, Ms. Porter explores her bi-curious side and builds up to a liaison with a couple. With a taste for fancy restaurants, fine wines, and men who make her laugh, Dawn's dates are an up-to-the minute look at modern dating from a clued-in young woman with her eyes on the prize. The question is, will she actually fall for any of her dates?",

        "description": "The heritage of literature in the French language is rich, varied, extensive in time and space, and appealing both to its immediate public--readers of French--and also to a global audience reached through translations and film adaptations. The first great works of this repertory were written in the twelfth century in northern France, and now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, this literature includes authors writing in many parts of the world, ranging from the Caribbean to Western Africa. This Very Short Introduction gives the reader a basic orientation to this lively literary world by focusing on texts (epics, novels, plays, poems, screenplays) that concern protagonists whose adventures and conflicts reveal shifts in literary and social practices. From the hero of the medieval Song of Roland to the Caribbean heroines of I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem or the European expatriate in Japan in Fear and Trembling, these problematic protagonists allow us to understand what interests writers and readers across the wide world of French literature.",

She bought the old Carson place on Cub Creek and moved to the Virginia countryside to prove she could live on her own terms. In the process, she learned some truths about herself and found love ~ but love, acceptance and belonging can be easier to find than to keep. While on a trip to Sicily with Libbie, Jim Mitchell leaves suddenly because his son is injured in an accident. Now alone, Libbie is surprised by an old friend, Dr. Barry Raymond, but Dr. Raymond is a reminder of her troubled past and she\u2019s glad to see the last of him when she leaves Sicily ~ until he shows up at her house on Cub Creek. Years before, Dr. Raymond told Libbie that if troubles weren\u2019t dealt with, they\u2019d keep coming back. With Jim still away helping his son, Libbie\u2019s troubles are returning in force and wreaking havoc on her confidence and their relationship. Libbie would rather hide than risk rejection, but she must face down the past and fight for what she wants, or the troubles that haunt her past and present will forever doom her future.",

Unmarried, she spends years as housekeeper for her brother-in-law because her sister is too ill to manage. Her sister dies, her brother-in-law remarries, and Annie Dunne is homeless. Invited by her cousin Sarah, she moves to a small farm in a remote part of Wicklow. As the novel opens, the two cousins share their lives and the work on the farm. It is the late 1950s and rural Ireland is changing around them. Annie's nephew heads for London in search of work and leaves his young children with their great-aunt. Content with her life with Sarah, Annie also finds a new capacity for love in her feelings for the two children. Yet even the small pleasures that Annie finds in her life are threatened. An unlikely suitor pays court to Sarah, and Annie's love for the children opens her up to pain almost as much as to happiness.Annie Dunneis a novel in which few external dramas occur--there is an accident with a pony and trap, one of the children goes temporarily missing--but Barry evokes superbly the inner dramas of his characters.",

        "description": "This is the story of the music, politics and culture during a seminal period of the ''baby boom'', 1958-1962. It''s an often hilarious story told from a most unlikely point of view; a precocious child born to a dirt-poor Southern woman. RAISING MAMA is a memoir. The voice is from the point of view of a child who became virtually an adult at age ten. RAISING MAMA is a road trip. Larry Sullivan, the voice and lead character, attends eight schools in five states in five years, 1958-1962. His mother''s favorite husband is a career criminal and, for Larry, reality is one surreal situation after another. RAISING MAMA is an American saga. It''s a love story rivaling ROMEO & JULIET. It''s TOM SAWYER in Jack Kerouac''s world. The stream of consciousness narration is a literate voice from the underclass. Larry and his mother, Dot, are Cherokee descendants and their life is a matriarchy in constant conflict with the dominant culture. Larry is from Memphis, Tennessee and watches Rock ''n Roll being born in his hometown. All women who have committed to a relationship, had a child or participated in the workforce will understand Dot''s plight. Few will understand Dot''s reaction to her circumstances; sometimes hilarious, but frequently tragic. The family is irrevocably affected by the Cold War as Larry''s step-dad tries to go straight for once. There is even a brush with infamy as MAMA works for one night for one of Jack Ruby''s businesses. The narration describes the late 1950''s as they were; with their racial tensions, anti-Communism and the beginnings of Rock ''n Roll and the counter-culture.",

        "description": "Magic, danger, and adventure abound for messenger Karigan G'ladheon in the third book in Kristen Britain's New York Times-bestselling Green Rider fantasy seriesMore than a thousand years ago, the armies of the Arcosian Empire, led by sorcerer Mornhavon the Black, crossed the great sea and tried to conquer the land of Sacoridia using terrible dark magic. Eventually, Mornhavon was captured, and his evil spirit imprisoned in Blackveil Forest. Since that day, the perimeter of Blackveil\u2014now a dark and twisted land\u2014has been protected by the magical D\u2019Yer Wall. But in the centuries since the war\u2019s end, knowledge of the working of magic disappeared from Sacoridia, due to the fear and prejudice of a people traumatized by Mornhavon\u2019s sorceries. Karigan G\u2019ladheon is now a seasoned Green Rider\u2014a member of the magical messenger corps of the king. But during her first year as a Rider, a rogue magician cracked the mighty D\u2019Yer Wall. The spirit of Mornhavon, sensing the weakness, began to wake, seeking vengeance, and causing frightening aberrations throughout the land. Karigan managed to transport the spirit of Mornhavon into the future, buying valuable time for her king and country. But how far in the future is Mornhavon now? A hundred years? Ten? Only one year? There is no way to tell. And though Karigan and her fellow Riders have scoured the land searching for lost magical knowledge, and members of Clan D\u2019Yer are camped at the wall, hoping to uncover its lost secrets, they were unaware of a threat to their kingdom that lay far closer. For there were Arcosian soldiers who survived the Long War, and the descendants of those ancient enemies spent generations honing their powers of dark magic\u2014a force against which the Sacoridians have no defense....",

        "description": "It could be said that women invented science fiction; after all, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is considered by many to be the first science fiction novel. Yet some readers seem to have this funny idea that women don\u2019t, or can\u2019t, write science fiction. Some have even gone so far as to accuse women of destroying science fiction with their girl cooties. So to help prove how silly that notion is, LIGHTSPEED's June 2014 issue is a Women Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and has a guest editor at the helm.The issue features original fiction by Seanan McGuire, Charlie Jane Anders, N.K. Jemisin, Carrie Vaughn, Maria Dahvana Headley, Amal El-Mohtar, and many more. All together there's more than 180,000 words of material, including: 11 original short stories, 15 original flash fiction stories, 4 short story reprints and a novella reprint, 7 nonfiction articles, and 28 personal essays by women about their experiences reading and writing science fiction.Table of ContentsFROM THE EDITORSEditorial, June 2014: Women Destroy Science Fiction!ORIGINAL SHORT STORIES \u2014 edited by Christie YantEach to Each by Seanan McGuireA Word Shaped Like Bones by Kris MilleringCuts Both Ways by Heather ClitheroeWalking Awake by N.K.

The 1979 find of a frozen, extinct steppe bison in an Alaskan gold mine allowed paleontologist Dale Guthrie to undertake the first scientific excavation of an Ice Age mummy in North America and to test theories about these enigmatic frozen fauna. In this brilliant remaking of the death of a wooly bison over 36,000 years ago, we\u2019re given a glimpse of what life was like during the Pleistocene Epoch. From torn fragments and patches of deep-frozen skin and insights gleaned from studies of Montana bison, African lions, and Iberian cave art,Ice Age Forensicspresents the story of the huge carcass Guthrie calls \u201cBlue Babe\u201d\u2014and the excitement surrounding its reconstruction.",

Unwaveringly optimistic at his chance of survival, the risky surgery that saves his life also ends the euphoric bliss, leaving his brain with a cavernous hole where the pleasure centers used to be. The 18 years of sadness that follow are a downward spiral of despair, and as a last resort he agrees to another treatment that gives him conscious control over what makes him happy. As he attempts to re-enter the world beyond the hospitals and his gloomy apartment, he faces the ultimate dilemma of self-control ... how happy would you be if you could make yourself as happy as you want?

Longer for others. If a ship crew were to find themselves damaged and adrift, it could be a long time before anyone finds them, if ever.In an attempt to make space travel safer, the Central Government established the Rescue and Assistance Guild. The guild employs and licenses independent ship captains to patrol the trade routes and areas around Earth, Mars, and several space stations, searching for ships in need of mechanical or medical assistance.Captain Joseph Shaw has had his ship, Crash Wagon, licensed with the guild for over seventeen years. His three main priorities have always been the safety of his crew, his ship, and the people they manage to rescue. Shaw\u2019s rescue record with the guild is one of the best. He enjoys his crew and his job. But, when the dark and shrouded past of two of his crew members catches up to them, loyalties aboard the ship are questioned. The crew find themselves caught in a struggle between warring organized crime families and faced with the very real possibility that some aboard the Crash Wagon may not be what they seem.Crash Wagon: Book One - Family Ties is the first book in a five-book series of novellas and is 19,561 words long.",

        "description": "In the early grades, talking and drawing can provide children with a natural pathway to writing, yet these components are often overlooked. In Talking, Drawing, Lessons for Our Youngest Writers , authors Martha Horn and Mary Ellen Giacobbe invite readers to join them in classrooms where they listen, watch, and talk with children, then use what they learn to create lessons designed to meet children where they are and lead them into the world of writing. The authors make a case for a broader definition of writing, advocating for formal storytelling sessions, in which children tell about what they know, and for focused sketching sessions so that budding writers learn how to observe more carefully.The book's lessons are organized by topic and include oral storytelling, drawing, writing words, assessment, introducing booklets, and moving writers forward. Based on the authors' work in urban kindergarten and first-grade classes, the essence and structure of many of the lessons lend themselves to adaptation through fifth grade. The lessons follow a consistent What's going on in the classroom? What do children need to learn next? Materials needed to teach the lesson Language used in each lesson Reasons behind why certain books are chosen and suggestions for additional children\u2019s books The authors show the thinking behind their teaching decisions and provide a way to look at and assess children's writing, giving us much more than a book of lessons; they present a vision of what beginning writing can look and sound like. Perhaps most powerfully, they give us examples of the language they use with children that reveal a genuine respect for and trust in children as learners.",

        "description": "Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns is a memorable figure not only for his successes as a composer of choral and orchestral works, and the eternally popular opera Samson et Dalila, but also because he was a keen observer of the musical culture in which he lived. A composer of vast intelligence and erudition, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was at the same time one of the foremost writers on music in his day. From Wagner, Liszt and Debussy to Milhaud and Stravinsky, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was at the center of the elite musical and cultural fin de si\u00e8cle and early 20th-century world. He championed Schumann and Wagner in France at a period when these composers were regarded as dangerous subversives whose music should be kept well away from the impressionable student. Yet Saint-Sa\u00ebns himself had no aspirations to being a revolutionary, and his appreciation of Wagner the composer was tempered by his reservations over Wagner the philosopher and dramatist, suspicious as he was of what he called \"the Germanic preoccupation with going beyond reality.\" Whether defending Meyerbeer against charges of facility or Berlioz against those who questioned his harmonic grasp, Saint-Saens was always his own man: in both cases, he claimed, it was \"not the absence of faults but the presence of virtues\" that distinguishes the good composer.Saint-Sa\u00ebns's writings provide a well-argued counter-discourse to the strong modernist music critics who rallied around Debussy and Ravel during the fin de si\u00e8cle. And above all, they demonstrate a brilliantly sharp and active brain, expressing itself through prose of a Classical purity and balance, enlivened throughout with flashes of wit and, at times, of sheer malice.In this generously annotated volume, renowned scholar, seasoned translator and radio broadcaster Roger Nichols brings some of the composer's most striking and evocative writings brilliantly to life in English translation, many for the first time. Nichols has carefully chosen these selections for their intrinsic interest as historical documents to create a well-balanced and engaging view of the man, the music, and the age.",

His requirements are simple; a lady who will occupy her position with well-bred grace and chaperone his sister, Nell \u2013 but who will not bore him to distraction. He is acquainted with a number of ladies who could fulfill the first two but none who can achieve the last.Then, whilst accompanying Nell to what he speedily comes to regard as the house-party from hell, he meets Adeline Kendrick - acid-tongued and by no means beautiful, yet somehow alluring; a combination that Rockliffe finds infuriatingly provocative. Worse still, her relatives are quite deplorable - from Cousin Diana, a spoiled and ill-natured beauty, to manipulative and devious Uncle Richard. As a prospective bride, therefore, Adeline is out of the question. Until, that is, a bizarre turn of events cause the Duke to change his mind and make what his world will call a m\u00e9salliance.Once back in London, Nell, plays fast and loose with the affections of Harry Caversham, Rockliffe - whilst attempting to woo his elusive bride - begins to scent a mystery and Adeline finds herself confronting a family skeleton which emerges, without warning, from the closet. Intent on averting a scandal and unwilling to burden her husband with the secret, complications and misunderstandings inevitably ensue. But his Grace of Rockliffe is neither a fool nor a man to be easily defeated and his stylish Duchess, no milk-and-water maid. How all their difficulties are resolved and the m\u00e9salliance proved to be no such thing, is told in this lively sister-novel to The Parfit Knight.",

Tom Eisenman knows it doesn't have to be this way. He also knows that in order for men to develop authenticity, vulnerability, honesty, trust--the character traits of spiritual maturity--they must cultivate healthy relationships with their brothers on the journey. In The Accountable Man Eisenman shows men how to build friendships of camaraderie and relational depth. He casts a compelling vision of interdependence and spiritual vitality--a vision in which no man stands alone against the temptations of our twenty-first century. Perfect for use in men's groups, small groups or one-on-one accountability reationships, this helpful, hopeful book includes lists of straight-to-the-point questions that will help men challenge one another to spiritual maturity and integrity.",

In this follow-up to his blockbuster biblical studies, world-renowned scholar Eisenman not only gives us a full examination of James\u2019 relationship to the Dead Sea Scrolls, he also reveals the true history of Palestine in the first century and the real ?Jesus\u2019 of that time. It\u2019s a work of intriguing speculative history, complete with a conspiracy theory as compelling as any thriller.Eisenman begins with a ?Is there a ?New Testament Code?\u2019\u201d He proves that there is?and exposes the deliberate revisions, falsifications, and historical trivializations introduced into New Testament writings. In so doing, he identifies the Scrolls as the literature of the Messianic Movement in Palestine and ?decodes\u201d many favorite sayings in the Gospels, including ?These are the signs that the Lord did in Cana of Galilee.\u201d Offering a point-by-point analysis of James\u2019 relationship to the Dead Sea Scrolls, he illuminates such subjects as the ?Pella Flight,\u201d the wilderness camps, and Paul as an ?Herodian,\u201d and demonstrates how, once we have found the Historical James, we will find the Historical Jesus.Every page presents fascinating new insights and revelations that will leave Eisenman\u2019s many fans enraptured. And because it will coincide with the release of the similarly themed film of The Da Vinci Code , interest will be high.",

Now, thirteen years later, the evidence uncovered by a brilliant FBI agent reveals that Tom is innocent. When psychologist Alan Gregory is called in to ease Tom's return to life beyond bars, the young man's treatment will become one of the darkest, most menacing cases of Alan's career, one that will take him on a journey into the treacherous Colorado mountains, into the dark closets of a woman's disturbing past, and finally into the back alleys of Gregory's own mind. Is vengeance justified in the face of injustice and tragedy? The answer may rest in the mind, in the heart, or in the hard facts. In THE BEST REVENGE, the answers come in a shattering climax that could only have been written by a storyteller with a rare insight into the human psyche.",

He travels to the ancestral river of the Yupik Eskimos to see the only Fair Trade\u2013certified fishing company in the world. He makes clear how PCBs and mercury find their way into seafood; discovers how Mediterranean sea bass went global; challenges the author of Cod to taste the difference between a farmed and a wild cod; and almost sinks to the bottom of the South Pacific while searching for an alternative to endangered bluefin tuna.Fish, Greenberg reveals, are the last truly wild food \u2014 for now. By examining the forces that get fish to our dinner tables, he shows how we can start to heal the oceans and fight for a world where healthy and sustainable seafood is the rule rather than the exception.",

In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray \u2013 he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants \u2013 Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.With its experimental form and literary playfulness, Don Quixote generally has been recognized as the first modern novel. The book has had enormous influence on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, \"just as some people read the Bible.\"",

Thematically varied, they address history and historiography; political and social theory; law; medicine; divination; rhetoric; aesthetic theory; narrative; travel and geography; folksong; and philosophical and religious learning, all in relation to the unique trajectories of Tibetan civil and scholarly discourse. The editors begin each chapter with a survey of broader social and cultural contexts and introduce each translated text with a concise explanation. Concluding with writings that extend into the early twentieth century, this volume offers an expansive encounter with Tibet's exceptional intellectual heritage.",

        "description": "\"Terre. A sud del tempo\" \u00e8 una raccolta di versi plurale, sia per il significato duale dell'opera, sia per la variet\u00e0 delle tematiche trattate. Due sono, infatti, le terre a cui il titolo fa riferimento: la prima, fisica, reale, con i paesaggi, le atmosfere, le nature e gli elementi visionari; la seconda, metafisica, ideale, quasi onirica, con le reminiscenze, le suggestioni, le nostalgie e la propensione dell'io verso tutto ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 ormai perduto. Entrambe si collocano, come esplicitato dal sottotitolo, \"a sud del tempo\", ovvero in una dimensione spazio-temporale lontana dal centro e dal presente. La terra fisica, difatti, \u00e8 un estremo lembo di meridione (come si evince dal componimento che porta lo stesso titolo della raccolta) che si colloca ai margini del tempo e che persiste nella sua staticit\u00e0 e inviolabilit\u00e0. Al contrario, la terra metafisica altro non \u00e8 che una proiezione del passato che, sebbene lontano, si contraddistingue per la sua dinamicit\u00e0 e per il suo ricorrere quasi ossessivo.",

        "description": "Freedom. In 1776 New England, that word is on everyone's lips. But for 13-year-old Isabel, the word holds a different meaning, especially after the only mistress she has ever known dies, and instead of receiving the freedom promised, she and her younger sister, Ruth, are sold to the Locktons, a wealthy New York family.In a matter of hours Isabel has to leave bucolic Rhode Island for the hustle and bustle of colonial New York City - a community intensely divided and caught up in the American colonies struggle for independence. As Isabel tries to work out her own freedom, she soon finds herself a pawn in a game of cat-and mouse between the Locktons, who are fierce supporters of the king, and the growing rebel forces trying to take over the city.Alliances are made and promises are broken, and Isabel learns the hard way that the \"freedom\" she's being asked to spy for does not extend to her. And when her beloved Ruth is sold off, she begins to discover that the only freedom she'll ever have is the freedom she takes for herself.Laure Halse Anderson delivers in this utterly compelling novel, which transcends (and will ultimately redefine) the category of historical fiction. Equal parts political thriller and coming-of-age story, this impeccably researched yet completely accessible story of a young woman's quest for freedom brings the American Revolution to life in all its grand and conflicted glory.Listening Length: 7 hours and 35 minutes",

        "description": "Just when Julian Schwarzenberg accepted that discarding his kinkster skin might be for the best, a call from the owner of one of London's BDSM clubs rekindles his need to have someone to call his own; to dominate and nurture to his heart\u2019s content. Julian was hurt in the past, and he\u2019s reluctant to accept a mystery invitation that could very well lead to a massive case of heartache. And to welcome Christopher into his life might just be Julian\u2019s undoing.Christopher\u2019s life is like a permanent construction unstable and filled to the brim with flakes of emotional plaster. His eating disorder is consuming him from within, and his quest for Dominant Mr. Right--the one thing keeping him going--is a mirage akin to finding water on Mars. But fate finally delivers one effective punch--a smokingly hot Dom who is on the hunt for Submissive Mr. Right. Love may be waiting for Julian and Chris, but it will require them to take a leap of faith. They might just be willing, because they're both Ravenous .",

There is no such celebration on Tah\u2019Nar, but that doesn\u2019t stop Keyno from trying to bring happiness to Dale. He\u2019s not only a starship captain, he\u2019s also an excellent strategist. He gathers his closest friends\u2014Doc and Gibor\u2014and researchers the holiday.He finds three important things about Christmas: First there is an older, heavyset male called the Santa Claus. The second is the holiday usually revolves around a tree laden with shiny baubles and lights with gifts under it. And finally they learn they\u2019re supposed to eat way too much, then lie around and moan because they ate too much.Humans are so odd.These mighty warriors survived the birth of their young, surely an undertaking of this magnitude is not beyond their grasp.

        "description": "\"With this delightful anthology, Frucht throws a bridge across the chasm separating the 'Two Cultures' of science and literature.\"--Booklist\"A marvelous colledtion of diverse talents and writing.\"--San Diego Union-TribuneA wildly inventive treasury of the most artful words ever written about numbers. Mathematics and writing may seem to exist in opposite realms, but as William Frucht reveals, the world of numbers has always held a special fascination for men and women of letters. Imaginary Numbers displays the fruits of this cross-fertilization by collecting the best creative writing about mathematical topics from the past hundred years. In this engaging anthology, we can explore the many ways writers have played with mathematical ideas. Delve into the fourth dimension and infinity, into fantasy and philosophy with such masters as Lewis Carroll, Edwin Abbott Abbott, Philip K. Dick, Martin Gardner, and Alan Lightman. Revel in renowned tales by Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, cult classics such as Connie Willis's \"The Schwartzschild Radius,\"and lesser-known gems by such visionaries as William Gibson and A. K. Dewdney. For mathematical mavens and literary lions alike, Imaginary Numbers adds up to one fascinating read.",

She is on the eve of this important event, and cannot wait for her life to change. As well as guaranteeing supermodel looks, life as a Pretty seems to revolve around having a good time. But then she meets Shay, who is also fifteen - but with a very different outlook on life. Shay isn't sure she wants to be Pretty and plans to escape to a community in the forest - the Rusty Ruins - where Uglies go to escape ' turning'. Tally won't be persuaded to join her, as this would involve sacrificing everything she's ever wanted for a lot of uncertainty. When she is taken in for questioning on her birthday, however, Tally gets sent to the Ruins anyway - against her will. The authorities offer Tally the worst choice she could ever imagine: find her friend Shay and turn her in, or never turn Pretty at all. What she discovers in the Ruins reveals that there is nothing 'pretty' about the transformations... And the choice Tally makes will change her world forever.",

        "description": "'Something strange happened within that family, Harry. People died and people disappeared, and although most of us suspected something odd had occurred, no one ever got at the truth.'Journalist Harry Fizglen is sceptical when his editor asks him to investigate the background of Simone Anderson, a new Bloomsbury artist. But once he's met the enigmatic Simone, Harry is intrigued. Just what did happen to Simone's twin sister who disappeared without trace several years before? And what is the Anderson sisters' connection to another set of twin girls, Viola and Sorrel Quinton, born in London on 1st January 1900?All Harry's lines of enquiry seem to lead to the small Shropshire village of Weston Fferna and the imposing ruin of Mortmain House, standing grim and forbidding on the Welsh borders. As Harry delves into the violent and terrible history of Mortmain, in an attempt to uncover what happened to Simone and Sonia, and, a century before them, to Viola and Sorrel Quinton, he finds himself drawn into a number of interlocking mysteries, each one more puzzling - and sinister - than the last.'Rayne handles a complicated story with many skeins very cleverly.

The victim of a restlessness he calls -Shanghai Dancing, - Antonio seeks to understand the source of his condition in his family's wanderings. Reversing his parents' own migration, Antonio heads back to their native Shanghai, where his world begins to fragment as his ancestry starts to flood into his present, and emissaries of glittering pre-war China, evangelical Liverpool and seventeenth-century Portugal merge into contemporary backdrops across Asia, Europe and Australia. A -fictional autobiography, -Shanghai Dancingis a dazzling meditation on identity, language and disorientation that combines photographs and written images in the style of W.G. Sebald.The Agehas described the book as -an extraordinary polyglot mix of sources: Portuguese, Chinese, English, Jewish and Catholic, and a mysterious recessive black gene... told in Castro's characteristically baroque prose, dense with its passion for language and serious wordplay.- The winner of some of Australia's top literary prizes,Shanghai Dancinghas been praised by its judges as -a work of major significance [that] challenges our expectations of storytelling... It is impressive as history, as fiction, as a book which stretches the literary form and which speaks to the universality of the human experience.-Shanghai Dancingmarks the U.S. debut of a major Australian literary figure.",

        "description": "This sweeping history traces eleven generations of the Clays of Kentucky, a founding American family and Southern dynasty whose members include Henry Clay, who ran for president against James K. Polk; his cousin Cassius Marcellus Clay, a prominent abolitionist and Lincoln\u2019s advisor against slavery; and matriarch Kizzie Clay, who buried the family silver and escaped by flatboat to avoid marauding Union soldiers. The history of the early colonial period comes to life, beginning with the arrival of the Clay family in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1613 and the Cecil family in St. Mary\u2019s, Maryland, in 1634, continuing through their trek across Virginia to the Appalachian Mountains, leading to the families\u2019 eventual intermarriage in 1800 and their move across the mountains to Kentucky and beyond.Drawing from original sources such as Civil War records, land deeds, wills, and letters, and through her own dogged detective work and determination to separate reality from exaggeration to understand the complex legacy she has inherited, Katherine Bateman reveals the adventures, accomplishments, and shortcomings of the men in her family, alongside the deep-rooted stories and nontraditional roles of its strong, sometimes selfish, and proud women.",

For the first time, an anthropologist had managed to gain the trust and long-term friendship of street-level drug dealers in one of the roughest ghetto neighborhoods--East Harlem. This new edition adds a prologue describing the major dynamics that have altered life on the streets of East Harlem in the seven years since the first edition. In a new epilogue Bourgois brings up to date the stories of the people--Primo, Caesat, Luis, Tony, Candy--who readers come to know in this remarkable window onto the world of the inner city drug trade. Philippe Bourgois is Professor and Chair of the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He has conducted fieldwork in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest and is the author of Ethnicity at Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989). He is writing a book on homeless heroin addicts in San Francisco. 1/e hb ISBN (1996) 0-521-43518-8 1/e pb ISBN (1996) 0-521-57460-9",

        "description": "It can break your heart to have a sister like Virginia Woolf.London, 1905: The city is alight with change, and the Stephen siblings are at the forefront. Vanessa, Virginia, Thoby, and Adrian are leaving behind their childhood home and taking a house in the leafy heart of avant-garde Bloomsbury. There they bring together a glittering circle of bright, outrageous artistic friends who will grow into legend and come to be known as the Bloomsbury Group. And at the center of this charmed circle are the devoted, gifted Vanessa, the painter, and Virginia, the writer.Each member of the group will go on to earn fame and success eventually, but so far Vanessa Bell has never sold a painting. Virginia Woolf's book review has just been turned down by The Times . Lytton Strachey has not published anything. E. M. Forster has finished his first novel but does not like the title. Leonard Woolf is still a civil servant in Ceylon, and John Maynard Keynes is looking for a job. Together, this sparkling coterie of artists and intellectuals throw away convention and embrace the wild freedom of being young, single bohemians in London.But the landscape shifts when Vanessa unexpectedly falls in love and her sister feels dangerously abandoned. Eerily possessive, charismatic, manipulative, and brilliant, Virginia has always lived in the shelter of Vanessa's constant attention and encouragement. Without it, she careens toward self-destruction and madness. As tragedy and betrayal threaten to destroy the family, Vanessa must decide if it is finally time to protect her own happiness above all else.The work of exciting young newcomer Priya Parmar, Vanessa and Her Sister exquisitely captures the champagne-heady days of prewar London and the extraordinary lives of sisters Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf.",

        "description": "Medicine has triumphed in modern times, transforming the dangers of childbirth, injury, and disease from harrowing to manageable. But when it comes to the inescapable realities of aging and death, what medicine can do often runs counter to what it should.Through eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering this dynamic has produced. Nursing homes, devoted above all to safety, battle with residents over the food they are allowed to eat and the choices they are allowed to make. Doctors, uncomfortable discussing patients\u2019 anxieties about death, fall back on false hopes and treatments that are actually shortening lives instead of improving them. And families go along with all of it.In his bestselling books, Atul Gawande, a practicing surgeon, has fearlessly revealed the struggles of his profession. Now he examines its ultimate limitations and failures\u2014in his own practices as well as others\u2019\u2014as life draws to a close. And he discovers how we can do better. He follows a hospice nurse on her rounds, a geriatrician in his clinic, and reformers turning nursing homes upside down. He finds people who show us how to have the hard conversations and how to ensure we never sacrifice what people really care about.Riveting, honest, and humane, Being Mortal shows that the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life\u2014all the way to the very end.~ penguinrandomhouse.ca",

        "description": "In September 1928, when great storms were still unnamed, nearly 700 black men, women, and children were buried in an unmarked West Palm Beach ditch following the nation's second-deadliest hurricane. The savage gusts that churned the waters of Lake Okeechobee into a maelstrom of death afflicted victims of all races and classes, and produced tales of survival and loss among whites and blacks alike. The vast majority of the post-storm workers were poor black migrants; even if the hurricane was color-blind, the recovery and rebuilding effort were not. Palm Beach Post hurricane reporter and Florida native Eliot Kleinberg has penned the gripping tale of the killer hurricane. The storm's journey is chronicled as it kills perhaps 7,000 people along its path from the Caribbean to Canada, including a low official tally of 1,836 in Florida alone. Detailing the storm's track, the failure to properly predict landfall, personal battles against nature's wrath, and the extraordinary suffering of a black citizenry forced to provide a disproportionate amount of rebuilding labor and endure the burial of friends and family in an unmarked pit, Kleinberg tells a powerful story of man versus nature and man versus man.",

In this collection, the author has chosen ten of the most engaging classic tales from the Buddha's works.

        "description": "This is a highly informative book, perhaps the best published on the substance of WikiLeaks, its technology, philosophy, origin and purpose, rooted in the Cypherpunks resistance to authority through encryption and anonymizing technology. The trenchant and salient, wide-ranging discussion among Assange, Appelbaum, M\u00fcller-Maguhn and Zimmermann, is derived from a four-part RT series with additional editorial material and a summarizing prologue by Assange, \"A Call to Cryptographic Arms.\" It is an excellent introduction to the struggle for control of digital communications, economics and governance. A prime candidate for inclusion of reading lists of the enemies of authoritarian institutions, corporations and governments heavily invested in the Internet and aiming to control it by secret collusion for their purposes -- at the global public's expense, loss of privacy and reduced democracy. It claims to be a \"watchman's warning\" against the threat posed by the Internet and cellphone technology. The panel asserts: 1. The internet is a threat to human civilization because of its panoptic surveillance and profiling of users. 2. \"Strategic surveillance\" gathers all online and cellphone data as distinguished from tactical surveillance with is specifically targeted. 3. Internet and cellphones allow surveillance more efficiently and pervasively than in the physical world. 4. Individuals can be surveilled more easily if they remain mesmerized by computers, cellphones and social media. 5. Encryption prevents access to private secrets by official and commercial online surveillance and by cellphones. 6. Protestors in Arab Spring went to the streets when cellphone and online systems were disabled and thereby escaped digital surveillance. 7. General purpose computers avoid the built-in controls of special purpose computers and devices. 8. Free software avoids the control of restrictive governmental and commercial software. 9. Free encryption and anonymizing technologies can protect against authoritarian aggression embedded in the equipment and operating systems of computers, cellphones, networks, internet service providers, financial institutions and governments. 10. Younger generations will need to invent and distribute ideas, critiques, code and technology against the legacy controls of older generations indoctrinated in submissive acceptance of authority. 11. Diverse, heterogenic concepts and technology will be required to oppose centralizing, homogenizing intents of the government- and commerce-dominated Internet and cellphones. The greatest virtue of this book is its description of what comes after the lessons learned of Cypherpunks and WikiLeaks -- from the diverse initiatives nobody yet knows about due to deliberate avoidance of preening, crippling publicity. Lesson one: Protect yourself by keeping quiet, offline and sans cell, avoiding vanguards.",

        "description": "Introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. This text introduces current evolutionary game theory--where ideas from evolutionary biology and rationalistic economics meet--emphasizing the links between static and dynamic approaches and noncooperative game theory. Much of the text is devoted to the key concepts of evolutionary stability and replicator dynamics. The former highlights the role of mutations and the latter the mechanisms of selection. Moreover, set-valued static and dynamic stability concepts, as well as processes of social evolution, are discussed. Separate background chapters are devoted to noncooperative game theory and the theory of ordinary differential equations. There are examples throughout as well as individual chapter summaries. Because evolutionary game theory is a fast-moving field that is itself branching out and rapidly evolving, J\u00f6rgen Weibull has judiciously focused on clarifying and explaining core elements of the theory in an up-to-date, comprehensive, and self-contained treatment. The result is a text for second-year graduate students in economic theory, other social sciences, and evolutionary biology. The book goes beyond filling the gap between texts by Maynard-Smith and Hofbauer and Sigmund that are currently being used in the field. Evolutionary Game Theory will also serve as an introduction for those embarking on research in this area as well as a reference for those already familiar with the field. Weibull provides an overview of the developments that have taken place in this branch of game theory, discusses the mathematical tools needed to understand the area, describes both the motivation and intuition for the concepts involved, and explains why and how it is relevant to economics.",

His four rivals are so far behind him that, in racing terms, they are \"nowhere.\" Awestruck, his spectators know they are in the presence of greatness. Among the crowd are two men who, according to the tradition of the Sport of Kings, should not be associated with the horse who will become its greatest exponent. One, Eclipse's owner, is a meat salesman. The second, who wants to own Eclipse, is an adventurer who has made his money through roguery and gambling. He is also the companion of the madam of one of London's most notorious brothels. While this man will remain an outcast to the racing establishment, Eclipse will go on to become the undisputed, undefeated champion of his sport. He will found dynasties that will dominate the bloodstock market?not only in Britain, but in every other country where Thoroughbreds race. His influence will be such that ninety-five per cent of horses racing today are his male-line descendants. This is a vivid portrait of high and low life; of princes, paupers, and prostitutes; an era of passionate sport, ferocious gambling, and uninhibited sex. It's the story of a rank outsider who went on to become a national celebrity; and of the horse that became a national icon, and whose influence is transcendent 200 years later.",

Het probleem is echter dat het haar niet lukt een originele plot te bedenken waar ze echt tevreden over is. Totdat haar eigen leven in een thriller verandert Op een dag vindt ze in de gang een plastic tas met plukken uitgerukt blond haar. In eerste instantie denkt ze aan haar depressieve dochter, maar ze concludeert vervolgens dat het een grap van haar jongens moet zijn. Als het lichaam van Britt, de vriendin van een van haar zoons, na een aantal dagen in de omgeving wordt gevonden, bekruipt Ymke het gevoel dat de tas in de gang allesbehalve een grap was. Ze kan er niet omheen: iemand in haar gezin moet iets met de moord te maken hebben. Maar wie? En wat zegt Ymke wel of niet tegen de politie?",

        "description": "On the heels of the phenomenal success of The Primal Blueprint Cookbook, and in response to the growing demand for healthy meals that can be made with minimal time and effort, Quick & Easy Meals delivers over 100 mouth-watering recipes with easy-to-follow instructions that will get you in and out of the kitchen in 30-minutes or less. Now the dream of eating satisfying meals--even with little time to spare--controlling weight and feeling great has become a reality. Make your transition to Primal eating easy and fun with this innovative cookbook from Primal Blueprint author Mark Sisson, and acclaimed chef/food writer/photographer Jennifer Meier. With 300 brilliant, glossy, full-color photographs and dozens of Quick & Easy Tips throughout the book you'll see how delicious and simple to prepare Primal dishes can be. Save time with intuitive recipe steps, easy navigation, and great visual support. You'll find recipes for every traditional meal time -- Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Appetizers and Snacks -- and recipes for Sauces, Toppings and Rubs, which effortlessly turn bland salads, meats and hors d'ouevres into unique culinary creations. And with the \"Time in the Kitchen\" listed for each recipe you'll know exactly what to expect, be it 30 minutes or five. As detailed in The Primal Blueprint, losing excess body fat is all about insulin. Regulate insulin production by eliminating grains and sugars and you will lose weight, even if you don't exercise much or are cursed with the \"fat gene.\" Quick & Easy Meals makes this easier than ever, showing you how to transition from the great American grain-based diet to a Primal Blueprint diet featuring meat, seafood, fowl, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. Each recipe has a naturally low glycemic impact and comes with a complete macronutrient profile, so you know exactly what you're putting in your body - no guesswork required. As you build momentum for Primal eating, you'll find that you won't even miss the boring, low-fat, high-carb foods that previously were the central focus of your diet. And no matter your experience in the kitchen you'll learn how to prepare delectable dishes like Bacon Souffle Frittata, Dill and Caper Salmon Burgers and Chorizo and Almond-Crusted Halibut. This isn't a crash course diet, and this won't be a cookbook that collects dust on your bookshelf. These and other Primal recipes provide the foundation for a lifetime of healthy eating that you'll eagerly come back to again and again.",

        "description": "Introducing part 5 of The Role series...Graham Williams has it all. His father owns the most prestigious financial services firm in Southern California and is ready to retire and give the company to Graham. At age 27, he's a financial genius himself, one of the best in the firm. But partying and women, lots and lots of women, take up the majority of Graham's time when he's away from work (and sometimes even during work). But the tall, handsome, muscular partner has a huge problem; stop womanizing, find a wife and settle down--or lose the business that he deserves.Abigail Thomas thinks Hollywood sucks. After being here for four years trying to break into acting, she's a waitress at Denny's and an unnamed extra on a television show. She auditions to be a pretend server at Wolfgang Puck's after an Oscar party to help raise money for his charity. She knows that all of the contacts she could hope for will be there, and thinks that this could be her break.Instead, Graham and his best friend, Anthony Rigatoni, convince Abigail to become Graham's Fake Girlfriend for 60 days. The pay is great, the perks are endless, and all she has to do is meet his parents, spend two months in his beachfront penthouse condo, and collect her paycheck.Can Abbs and Graham pull it off? What will they do as they grow more and more attracted to each other? Can they fake it even if it's real? And what about the real contract Graham's father has presented--stay married for a year or you get nothing?Can two intelligent, attractive, self-assured people who know what they want, find the way to get it without destroying each other's life...or their own lives?** This hot alpha billionaire romance is perfect for fans of Ellie Danes, Kelly Flavor, J.S. Scott and Cassie Cross **",

The first draft was written while Genet was incarcerated in a French prison; when the manuscript was discovered and destroyed by officials, Genet, still a prisoner, immediately set about writing it again. It isn't difficult to understand how and why Genet was able to reproduce the novel under such circumstances, because Our Lady Of The Flowers is nothing less than a mythic recreation of Genet's past and then - present history. Combining memories with facts, fantasies, speculations, irrational dreams, tender emotion, empathy, and philosophical insights, Genet probably made his isolation bearable by retreating into a world not only of his own making, but one which he had total control over.",

Ben Connelly\u2019s Inside the Grass Hut unpacks the timeless poem and applies it to contemporary life. His book delivers a wealth of information on the context and content of this eighth-century work, as well as directly evokes the poem\u2019s themes of simple living, calm, and a deep sense of connection to all things.Each pithy chapter focuses on a single line of the poem, letting the reader immerse himself thoroughly in each line and then come up for air before moving on to the next. Line by line, Connelly shows how the poem draws on and expresses elements from the thousand years of Buddhist thought that preceded it, expands on the poem\u2019s depiction of a life of simple practice in nature, and tells stories of the way these teachings manifest in modern life. Connelly, like Shitou before him, proves himself adept at taking profound and complex themes from Zen and laying them out in a practical and understandable way.Eminently readable, thoroughly illuminating, Inside the Grass Hut shows the reader a path of wholehearted engagement\u2014with the poem, and with the world. Destined to become a trusted, dog-eared companion.",

Her \"knight in shining armor\" turns out to be less of a knight as time goes by and more of a heartbreak waiting to happen. As the saying goes, this is not what the doctor ordered. When the relationship ends, Heather's life dramatically changes as she finds herself addicted to prescription pills she never needed and her future as a mother in question. Set in the bustling city of New York, A Medical Affair by debut author Anne McCarthy Strauss could be a game changer for many women as it exposes the truth behind her doctor's behavior and her subsequent filing of a civil suit. Although a work of fiction, A Medical Affair was extensively researched. This is truly a story that must be told.",

Pero tambi\u00e9n arroja luz sobre los desaf\u00edos que los j\u00f3venes migrantes tienen al incorporarse a circuitos globales de trabajo bajo un r\u00e9gimen capitalista de acumulaci\u00f3n flexible, en el que experimentar\u00e1n nuevas formas de explotaci\u00f3n, precariedad, estigmatizaci\u00f3n y racismo, as\u00ed como de resistencia y afirmaci\u00f3n personal.A partir de una investigaci\u00f3n multisituada con j\u00f3venes zapotecos y tojolabales, se analiza el paso de la militancia en las luchas ind\u00edgenas a la migraci\u00f3n transnacional y la experiencia de estos nuevos migrantes una vez establecidos en Estados Unidos. La migraci\u00f3n de estos j\u00f3venes se enfoca como un desplazamiento geogr\u00e1fico, pol\u00edtico y subjetivo. Porque los j\u00f3venes no s\u00f3lo se trasladan miles de kil\u00f3metros desde sus pueblos para atravesar la frontera; tambi\u00e9n experimentan un cambio profundo de sus subjetividades personales y pol\u00edticas con respecto a la generaci\u00f3n anterior.Ellos a diferencia de sus padres, piensan que la v\u00eda pol\u00edtica, bajo todas sus expresiones, ha fracasado como alternativa para alcanzar una vida mejor; y en cambio, la migraci\u00f3n les parece el \u00fanico destino posible en un pa\u00eds con altos \u00edndices de desempleo y un campo devastado por tres d\u00e9cadas de pol\u00edticas neoliberales.",

They live a strongly traditional life, rich with story, music, dance, and magic, governed by the laws of the clan and the ways of the road. To the repressive Puritanical government of 17th century England, however, the gypsies are thieving, fortune-telling vagrants who are most likely allies of the devil.Soon, a series of terrible events lands the family in jail, charged with murder. Emilia and Luka manage to escape, promising to bring back help and free them. But how? Emilia believes in the legend of the charms: it is said that the luck of the Rom soured after a long-ago gypsy matriarch broke her chain of charms, giving one charm to each of her five children. If they can gather the charms from the families, Emilia thinks, the strong magic of the Rom will somehow bring her family freedom. Luka, on the other hand, is more practical he wants to enlist the help of the other clans to help the Finches escape. Emilia and Luka must race through the countryside, navigating a hornets' nest of Rom-hating Puritans, Royalist spies, and traitors, if they are to complete their quest before the magistrate delivers a death sentence",

        "description": "With dry wit and psychological acuity, this near-future novel explores the aftershocks of an economically devastating U.S. sovereign debt default on four generations of a once-prosperous American family. Down-to-earth and perfectly realistic in scale, this is not an over-the-top Blade Runner tale. It is not science fiction.In 2029, the United States is engaged in a bloodless world war that will wipe out the savings of millions of American families. Overnight, on the international currency exchange, the \u201calmighty dollar\u201d plummets in value, to be replaced by a new global currency, the \u201cbancor.\u201d In retaliation, the president declares that America will default on its loans. \u201cDeadbeat Nation\u201d being unable to borrow, the government prints money to cover its bills. What little remains to savers is rapidly eaten away by runaway inflation.The Mandibles have been counting on a sizable fortune filtering down when their ninety-seven-year-old patriarch dies. Once the inheritance turns to ash, each family member must contend with disappointment, but also\u2014as the U.S. economy spirals into dysfunction\u2014the challenge of sheer survival.Recently affluent, Avery is petulant that she can\u2019t buy olive oil, while her sister, Florence, absorbs strays into her cramped household. An expat author, their aunt, Nollie, returns from abroad at seventy-three to a country that\u2019s unrecognizable. Her brother, Carter, fumes at caring for their demented stepmother, now that an assisted living facility isn\u2019t affordable. Only Florence\u2019s oddball teenage son, Willing, an economics autodidact, will save this formerly august American family from the streets.The Mandibles is about money. Thus it is necessarily about bitterness, rivalry, and selfishness\u2014but also about surreal generosity, sacrifice, and transformative adaptation to changing circumstances.",

        "description": "Back in December 2014, I made a big announcement online and in social Genealogy and I are parting ways. Done. Finished. Game over. Have you ever said to yourself, \u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019ve had it and it just isn\u2019t worth it anymore!\u201d Well, have you? Sort of like the character Howard Beale in the movie Network when he says, live on air, \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore!\u201d By the end of 2014, after more than 25 years of researching my own family history, that is how I felt. My Past Genealogy Research Frustrates Me! While many who read my post thought that I was leaving the genealogy community or closing down my genealogy business, I had to clarify what I meant by \u201c\u201d Starting in 2015, I planned on setting my 20+ years of genealogy research aside and starting over. From scratch. Seriously. How many times have you thought about doing the same thing? Did you start your research the same way I did, by just collecting names, grabbing stuff from other online trees, or pasting text into your genealogy software? Lately, has the prospect of going back and citing sources or proving facts and evidence brought you down and ruined your genealogy buzz? Do you throw up your hands and say, \u201cI give up!\u201d only to return to the same review and edit process days or weeks later? If you are like me, you need a genealogy makeover. Better yet, a Genealogy Do-Over. That is what I decided to call the journey upon which I embarked in early 2015. Now I want you to come along. Genealogy A New Journey of Genealogical Discovery Here is the short summary of The Genealogy I set aside everything* related to my genealogy research including notebooks, papers, and even digitized files and my genealogy database files and START OVER. I\u2019m hitting the reset button. I\u2019m allowing myself to have a do-over! (* certain items such as vital records ordered and paid for or research gathered on long-distance trips can be retained). Since I started my initial research, much has changed in the areas of genealogy research methodology and education. I now realize the need to collect facts and track them properly, including the use of source citations. I now understand the process of analyzing evidence and proving facts to reach a conclusion. In essence, I know a lot more about the \u201cprocess\u201d of genealogical research and I want to put it to use. This is not to say that I have not been following proven guidelines when it comes to finding family history. For my research clients (mostly pro bono), I actually employ all the methods advocated by many in the genealogy community. However, when it comes to my own research from years ago, I am not walking the walk . . . I have just been talking the talk. It is not always easy to \u201cwalk backwards\u201d and review every bit of information gathered over the years. Instead, I wanted to do more than re-walk a trodden I wanted to head out from the same starting point and see where the journey took me. I knew I would have access to better tools, better knowledge and be better equipped for each twist and turn. Now, I encourage you to join me on this journey. The Genealogy Do-Over journey is constructed of 12 Steps that can be easily followed. You can choose to pace yourself as you see fit. You can even decide to drop some of the less important tasks and add your own. Do whatever it takes to ensure that you are on a firm footing to finding your ancestors.",

E se a scandire il tempo e a dettare l'urgenza di queste cronache sono gli accadimenti del mondo, \u00e8 la poesia pi\u00f9 vera a ispirare le pagine dedicate alla notte in cui Obama ha vinto le elezioni americane, al ricordo di Fernando Pessoa o di Rosa Parks la sarta di Montgomery, Alabama, che viaggiando in autobus si rifiut\u00f2 di cedere il posto a una persona di razza bianca -, come pure l'omaggio alla citt\u00e0 di Lisbona o l'episodio del ritorno alla Torre di Bel\u00e9m della statua dell'elefante che d\u00e0 il titolo al suo ultimo romanzo. Contributi vibranti, densi di acume e fervida immaginazione, che ci rivelano un Saramago, come scrive Umberto Eco nella prefazione, \"impenitentemente irritato, e tenero\".",

And yet, all his years of service helping patients and their families adjust to the challenges of aging did not prepare him for becoming father to his own father, who had become as needy as any child.In Memory Lessons --a tender and provocative book--Dr. Winakur writes about what it's like to be medical counselor to countless patients, while disclosing his personal heartbreak at watching his 86-year-old father descend into disability and dementia, his mother at his side. In both of these roles--highly skilled professional and loving son--he finds he is hard pressed to alter a course that devastates his dad and tears at his family. But he does what he can. A doctor who does his best to listen carefully to each patient in turn, who attempts to confront every problem with, as he says, \"a reasonable fund of knowledge, a modicum of common sense, and a large dose of honesty,\" Dr. Winakur knows that there is much we can do by loving and listening.We all search for answers; we all want to do the right thing for our parents, but few of us know what that right thing is. Faced with caring for a growing sea of elders, Dr. Winakur reflects on his thirty years in the medical profession to consider the very personal and immediate questions asked by families every What are we going to do with Dad? Who will care for him--and how? These are urgent questions, and they're faced head-on in Memory Lessons with unflinching honesty, hope, and, above all, love.",

        "description": "Las corrientes del espacio es una novela escrita en 1952 por el autor estadounidense de ciencia ficci\u00f3n Isaac Asimov. Es el segundo libro del Tr\u00edptico del Imperio Gal\u00e1ctico, que a su vez es la segunda parte de la Saga de la Fundaci\u00f3n. El Tr\u00edptico del Imperio est\u00e1 ubicado en la \u00e9poca de la Segunda Oleada de Colonizaci\u00f3n, que avanz\u00f3 m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los Mundos Espaciales, colonizando numerosos planetas de la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea. Cada uno de los 3 libros del Tr\u00edptico est\u00e1 conectado a los otros libros, separados por un intervalo bastante grande de siglos.La historia ocurre durante el ascenso de Tr\u00e1ntor desde ser una gran potencia regional hasta convertirse en un Imperio Gal\u00e1ctico, unificando millones de planetas. Esta historia ocurre alrededor del a\u00f1o 11.000 d. C. (inicialmente 34.500 d. C., seg\u00fan la cronolog\u00eda de Asimov a principios de los a\u00f1os 1950), cuando el Imperio Trantoriano abarca aproximadamente la mitad de la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea.El planeta independiente Sark explota al planeta Florina y saca su gran riqueza procedente del kyrt, que es una fibra vers\u00e1til que s\u00f3lo puede ser cultivada en Florina. La relaci\u00f3n entre los dos planetas es an\u00e1loga a la situaci\u00f3n entre las metr\u00f3polis imperiales y sus colonias a mediados del siglo XX, donde fuerzan a los florinianos a trabajar en campos de kyrt y son tratados como una raza inferior por los sarkitas. Los intentos de romper el monopolio de Sark y cultivar kyrt en otros planetas hasta ahora han culminado en fracaso. Mientras tanto, Tr\u00e1ntor desea anexionar a su creciente Imperio estos 2 planetas.Hay una broma oculta o una iron\u00eda en el dominio de Sark sobre Florina: el paralelo claro con el Sur americano que cultivaba algod\u00f3n con el trabajo de los esclavos. El floriniano es una de las personas m\u00e1s morenas en una galaxia donde las categor\u00edas raciales parecen haber sido olvidadas, excepto por la gente de Sark. Uno de los protagonistas del libro, el doctor Selim Junz, es nativo del planeta Libair, donde viven algunos de los individuos m\u00e1s morenos de la V\u00eda L\u00e1ctea y siente compasi\u00f3n por los florinianos (el planeta Libair toma su nombre de Liberia, un pa\u00eds en \u00c1frica, que explicar\u00eda una herencia gen\u00e9tica de piel morena).La posible destrucci\u00f3n de Florina es predicha por Rik, un analista del espacio, cuya mente ha sido manipulada por el dispositivo de la sonda ps\u00edquica, caus\u00e1ndole amnesia. Cuando Rik comienza a recordar su pasado, provoc\u00f3 una crisis pol\u00edtica entre Sark, Florina y Tr\u00e1ntor. Rik, nativo de la Tierra, hab\u00eda descubierto que el sol de Florina est\u00e1 a punto de convertirse en una nova porque est\u00e1 siendo alimentado por el carbono del espacio exterior, en las denominadas as\u00ed \"corrientes del espacio\", que act\u00faan mas bien como corrientes oce\u00e1nicas.Tambi\u00e9n es revelado al fin y al cabo que la longitud de onda especial en\u00e9rgica de luz que est\u00e1 siendo emitida por el sol de Florina es lo que permite el cultivo de alta calidad de la fibra kyrt en Florina. Esta es la explicaci\u00f3n de porque el kyrt no puede ser cultivado en otros planetas -ya que las estrellas en el proceso de convertirse en novas son muy raras y sobre todo estrellas con planetas habitados-.Sin Florina, Sark perder\u00eda su fuente de riqueza, por lo cual hay renuencia en Sark para aceptar la destrucci\u00f3n de Florina. La soluci\u00f3n para Tr\u00e1ntor es comprar el planeta entero, lo que resultar\u00eda ser muy costoso, pero probablemente ser\u00eda reembolsado en buena voluntad.Incluso aunque no se haya establecido a\u00fan el Imperio Gal\u00e1ctico, Tr\u00e1ntor controla ya al planeta Tierra, que es en gran parte radioactivo, debido a los hechos relatados en Robots e Imperio. La idea de evacuar la Tierra es mencionada al final del libro, pero es fuertemente rechazada por Rik. \u00c9l insiste que la Tierra es el planeta original de la raza humana, aunque esto no sea generalmente aceptado.",

        "description": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was an American poet. He wrote the first American translation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy and was one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets. He established his literary career by submitting poetry and prose to various newspapers and magazines. Between January 1824 and his graduation in 1825, he had published nearly 40 minor poems. About 24 of them appeared in the short-lived Boston periodical The United States Literary Gazette. After graduating in 1825, he was offered a job as professor of modern languages at his alma mater. The story, possibly apocryphal, is that an influential trustee, Benjamin Orr, had been so impressed by Longfellow's translation of Horace that he was hired under the condition that he travel to Europe to study French, Spanish and Italian. When he returned to the United States in 1836, Longfellow took up the professorship at Harvard University. He began publishing his poetry, including Voices of the Night in 1839 and Ballads and Other Poems, which included his famous poem The Village Blacksmith, in 1841. His other works include Paul Revere's Ride, A Psalm of Life, The Song of Hiawatha, Evangeline and Christmas Bells.",

The advice given in this book are in line witht the thought that many experts agree upon, to train a child with loving kindness, patience and positive reinforcements. One thing parents will realize once they have a baby is soon they will have to learn how to discipline a toddler. Disciplining a toddler is not something parents automatically know how to do. When our sweet babies gain the ability to walk and use their legs they become independent little humans and they will flex those independent muscles, which can get them into situations that require us to know how to discipline toddlers the right way. It takes great patience to train a child into behaving well.",

        "description": "The Study of Murder pits Scottish sleuth Muirteach MacPhee against a mysterious adversary in the medieval town of Oxford in 1374. At the command of the Lord of the Isles, Muirteach and his wife Mariota accompany Donald, the lord's surly thirteen-year-old son, to Oxford where Donald is to enroll in university. Shortly after their arrival a winsome tavern maid disappears. At his charge's insistence, Muirteach attempts to help Undersheriff Grymbaud with the investigation, as well as keep Donald at his studies and out of the taverns. He has little success with either venture, although the discovery of some bizarre and suggestive drawings on old parchments piques the curiosity of Donald and his peers. Meanwhile, Mariota thirsts to attend medical lectures at the schools, which are closed to women, and seeks a way to gain admittance to them. When an Oxford master is found brutally bludgeoned to death, Grymbaud asks Muirteach to investigate the slaying. The eventual arrest of an aged servant at the college stirs the ever-simmering discord between townsfolk and university students. The unrest culminates in riots and another senseless killing occurs, endangering Mariota. Gleaning clues from a cryptic manuscript and desperate to save his wife, a determined Muirteach tracks a wily killer through a dark and twisted labyrinth of deceit.",

        "description": "Acclaimed as the Middle East\u2019s \"All Quiet on the Western Front\"The first eye-witness account ever published of the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, this riveting memoir of a young Israeli soldier became an instant bestseller on publication in 1949, and is still recognized as the outstanding book of that war, in the tradition of Erich Maria Remarque\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front. First joining the Givati Brigade and later volunteering for \"Samson\u2019s Foxes\", the legendary commando unit, Avnery took part in almost all the major battles on the Jerusalem and southern fronts. Written from the trenches, and from a military hospital bed, he offers an extraordinarily detailed account of the war, of fast-paced battles, and acts of extreme bravery, as well as the camaraderie and off-duty exploits of young men and women thrust into the front line. This is a gripping, sensitive, and at times deeply poignant account of the day-to-day brutalities of one of the most significant wars of our times.",

In fact, the Starian men are so busy fighting, their marriage ceremony has been reduced to a \"will of the gods\" event where they simply pick a woman out of a lineup and claim her as a wife. With women becoming scarce, it's necessary to trade the offworld Divinity Corporation for brides. Duty-bound to attend the ceremony, Sorin has no intention of picking a bride, let alone one from another dimension. That is, until he sees Lilith, the bewitching woman sent by the gods to reward-or punish?-him.Lilith, a data analyst for Divinity, is betrayed by the Corporation and wakes up in a primitive, uncharted dimension filled with warriors who know only war and duty. Her fear of becoming a sex slave to a big, beefy knight becomes all too real when a warrior of god-like proportions claims she's his new woman. As Lilith discovers, there are worse fates than being the focus of Sorin's skillful and earthy seduction.",

However, the principles included are actually useful for all disciples of Christ who are seeking to live in a way that best honors Him. Spending just a few minutes at the beginning of your day (and reflecting on those thoughts during free time throughout the day) can allow God's Word to be the instrument that liberates you from both the lust of the flesh and the letter of the law.",

        "description": "Someone is chasing Amy Watson in the small western Florida community. After running into an adorable man named Mark Dallas at the beach, she realizes he's not all he seems to be, becoming almost like a superhero to her. He has bodyguards from his business--a gaming software company named Madcap--and seems to know all the big shots in town. But when she confronts him, he just says he's an ordinary programmer. When a dead body is found in Amy's apartment, it's time that Mark sets the record straight, leading them on a scavenger hunt around the nation to find out why Amy's being targeted. Could it be because she's collaborated with the NSA to tell them how to do their job, or maybe her ties to the Department of Homeland Security to explain how to find terrorists without racial profiling? Or maybe it's a simple game of cat and mouse, hunting for something long lost. Regardless, Amy and Mark are on the run, to save her life while she gains the infamous glass slipper in Mark Dallas' world.Full-length story of about 64,000 words. Written in first person--mystery and romance.",

ReadHiding Out in Hollywoodon its own, or as the sequel toRock Star's Girl!After her very public romance with superstar singer Cory Sampson nearly cost Emily Watts her career, she's thrilled to be bouncing back with a new fashion column for the nation's top entertainment website. More than that, she's happy to be out of the media spotlight and is determined to never make tabloid headlines again. So when her new yoga classmate, Raine Kingston, wants to see Emily outside of class, she isn't sure what to do. Raine is funny, madly attractive, and he's one of the most charming men Emily has ever met. He's also a sought-after actor who tops Hollywood's A-list, and Emily knows being seen with him will destroy the privacy she's worked so hard to get back.She can't deny their connection, though, and Raine is willing to spend time together in places they won't be seen. Just when Emily is on top of the world with her new romance, her past finds its way back into the headlines, thanks to a music partnership between Cory and indie band guitarist Jesse Cinder, someone Emily counts among her enemies. With all eyes back on her, it gets harder to keep her dates with Raine a secret, and Emily is forced to choose: stay with Raine, who makes her the happiest she's ever been, and have her life back in the headlines, or give up the best relationship she's ever had to keep the privacy and normal life she craves.",

But the last thing she expects is to land in the arms of a cowboy during the Tom Jones Club convention. A hot week with a cowboy in Las Vegas is one thing-eternity is another.

        "description": "Continuing in the exuberant tradition ofSix of One, Bingo,andLoose Lips,New York Timesbestselling author Rita Mae Brown returns to her much-loved fictional hamlet of Runnymede, whose memorable citizens are welcoming both the end of the Great War and the beginning of a new era.The night a riot breaks out at the Capitol Theater movie house-during a Mary Pickford picture, no less-you can bet that the Hunsenmeir sisters, Louise and Julia, are nearby. Known locally as Wheezie and Juts, the inimitable, irrepressible, distinctly freethinking sisters and their delightful circle of friends are coming of age in a shifting world and are determined to understand their place in it. Across town, the well-to-do Chalfonte siblings are preparing for the upcoming wedding of brother Curtis. But for youngest sister Celeste, the celebration brings about a change she never expected and a lesson about love she ll not soon forget.Set against the backdrop of America emerging from World War I,Cakewalkis an outrageous and affecting novel about a small town where ideas of sin and virtue, love and sex, men and women, politics and religion, can be as divided as the Mason-Dixon Line that runs right through it and where there's no problem that can't be cured by a good yarn and an even better scotch. With her signature Southern voice, Rita Mae Brown deftly weaves generations of family stories into a spirited patchwork quilt of not-so-simple but joyously rich life.",

Cooking ahead.Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs, founders of the online kitchen and home destination Food52, pull off home-cooked dinners with their families with stunning regularity. But they don't cook every night.\u00a0Starting with flexible base dishes made on the weekend, Amanda and Merrill mix, match, and riff to create new dinners, lunches, and even desserts throughout the week. Blistered tomatoes are first served as a side, then become sauce for spaghetti with corn. Tuna, poached in olive oil on a Sunday, gets paired with braised peppers and romesco for a fiery dinner, with spicy mayo for a hearty sandwich, and with zucchini and couscous for a pack-and-go salad.\u00a0Amanda and Merrill\u2019s seasonal plans give you everything you need to set yourself up well for the week, with grocery lists and cooking timelines. They also share clever tips and tricks for more confident cooking, showing how elements can work across menus and seasons to fit your mood or market, and how to be scrappy with whatever\u2019s left in the fridge. These building blocks form A New Way to Dinner, the key to smarter, happier cooking that leaves you with endless possibilities for the week ahead.",

Same story, new cover, but edited. If you have already read DESIRE, first--Thank you, and second, the story is not different.* This is a love story with steamy love scenes between two men. But it's also a love story and one that I would not classify as \"Erotica\" -- though it has one erotic scene near the end. On a scale of 1-5, 1 being \"vanilla\" and 5 being \"this is so hot, I'm dying\"; I would rate this a 3.* This series has been published in \"Episodic Form\" aka, Installments. This means Novella #1 isn't the complete story. It stops at a good spot (cliffhanger), but not at the final conclusion. I know this bothers some folks, so I feel it is best to be upfront about it. This particular novella is about 50 pages long.***Other books in the FALLING FOR HIM Series:Hungry For You, Book 2Ready For You, Book 3 (the final book)",

        "description": "Neo-paganism is the attempt to revive the polytheistic religions of old Europe. But how? Can one just invent or reinvent an authentic, living faith? Or are modern neo-pagans just engaged in elaborate role-playing games? In SUMMONING THE GODS, Collin Cleary argues that the gods have not died or forsaken us so much as we have died to or forsaken them. Modern civilization-including much of modern neo-paganism-springs from a mindset that closes man off to the divine and traps us in a world of our own creations. Drawing upon sources from Taoism to Heidegger, Collin Cleary describes how we can attain an attitude of openness that may allow the gods to return. In these nine wide-ranging essays, Collin Cleary also explores the Nordic pagan tradition, Tantrism, the writings of Alain de Benoist, Karl Maria Wiligut, and Alejandro Jodorowski, and Patrick McGoohan's classic television series The Prisoner. Cleary's essays are models of how to combine clarity and wit with spiritual depth and intellectual sophistication.",

        "description": "As Peanuts reaches the mid-1980s, Charles Schulz is still creating and playing with new characters, and in this volume Snoopy's deadpan, droopy-mustached brother Spike takes center stage: Surrounded by coyotes in the desert where he lives and who are attacking him with rubber bands, he sends a frantic message to Snoopy who launches an expedition to save him. Then, he makes the long trek back to Snoopy's neck of the woods accompanied by his only friend (a cactus, of course) and throughout the rest of the book, pops up in hilarious, Waiting for Godot-style vignettes set in his native Needles.In romantic news, the Peppermint Patty-Marcie-Charlie Brown love triangle of overlapping unrequited love heats up (well, kind of), while Linus continues to vociferously deny that he is Sally's Sweet Babboo; of course, Lucy's unsuccessful pursuit of Schroeder remains unabated. Also, a romance blossoms between two of Snoopy's Beagle Scout birds. (We will pass over Spike's brief attraction to one of the coyotes.)In what is probably his most baroque and hilarious baseball-involved humiliation yet, Charlie Brown agrees to join Peppermint Patty's team, the Pelicans, only to discover that he's wanted not as a player but as a mascot. Linus gives up his security blanket and forms a support group for other kids who are trying to do the same, and Peppermint Patty manages to be held back in school (leaving a snoring ghost to take her place in the rest of the class that has advanced), and yet gets to go on a European trip with her dad, sending back periodic dispatches from the road. All this, plus appearances from Franklin, Rerun, and the rest of the gang in these strips from a period of Peanuts that's far less well-known than the endlessly-collected 1960s and 1970s eras.",

Such a practice offers the reader an opportunity to explore the mystery of human thought, interconnections, creativity, and design, our deepest intentions, in a perichoresis or divine dance of words, love, intimacy, and transformation. Through this dance and practice, this openness the reader may discover a spiritual indwelling, an intimacy, where we discover oneness at work throughout creation, where we find that we dwell within one another, come and dance this divine dance. \"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us (John 17:21).\"",

        "description": "Hailed as \"one of the best technical case studies in the whole literature of the social sciences\" upon its original publication in 1961, The Black Muslims in America in this third edition provides a new generation of readers with an enriched, up-to-date knowledge of the important but little- understood Black Muslim movement. This classic sociological study gives a concise, accessible introduction to Islam for Americans whose knowledge of religion is limited primarily to Judeo-Christianity. The book succinctly details the formation and development of the Black Muslim movement through its wide-ranging expressions in America today \u2014 a movement born as an organized form of religious and social protest against a society sharply divided by race. This edition includes a new foreword by Aminah B. McCloud, a new preface, and an extensive postscript by Lincoln in which he outlines the course of the Nation of Islam since the death of its formative leader, Elijah Muhammad, in 1975 \u2014 the sweeping changes wrought by Elijah's son and successor, Wallace Deen Muhammad, the disintegration of the Nation into splinter groups, and the emergence of Louis Farrakhan as the legitimate head of the \"new\" Nation. A section highlighting the public career of Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad's famous spokesperson turned cultural icon, is also included. In the wake of recent media events like the film Malcolm X and unsettling national events like the riot in Los Angeles, this timely update provides both fascinating reading and challenging reflection about an American religious group still shaping its destiny, and that of the nation.",

        "description": "There are 168 hours in a week. This book is about where the time really goes, and how we can all use it better.It's an unquestioned truth of modern we are starved for time. With the rise of two-income families, extreme jobs, and 24/7 connectivity, life is so frenzied we can barely find time to breathe. We tell ourselves we'd like to read more, get to the gym regularly, try new hobbies, and accomplish all kinds of goals. But then we give up because there just aren't enough hours to do it all. Or else, if we don't make excuses, we make sacrifices. To get ahead at work we spend less time with our spouses. To carve out more family time, we put off getting in shape. To train for a marathon, we cut back on sleep. There has to be a better way-and Laura Vanderkam has found one. After interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, she realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us. Instead of letting the daily grind crowd out the important stuff, they start by making sure there's time for the important stuff. They focus on what they do best and what only they can do. When plans go wrong and they run out of time, only their lesser priorities suffer. It's not always easy, but the payoff is enormous. Vanderkam shows that it really is possible to sleep eight hours a night, exercise five days a week, take piano lessons, and write a novel without giving up quality time for work, family, and other things that really matter. The key is to start with a blank slate and to fill up your 168 hours only with things that deserve your time. Of course, you probably won't read to your children at 2:00 am, or skip a Wednesday morning meeting to go hiking, but you can cut back on how much you watch TV, do laundry, or spend time on other less fulfilling activities. Vanderkam shares creative ways to rearrange your schedule to make room for the things that matter most. 168 Hours is a fun, inspiring, practical guide that will help men and women of any age, lifestyle, or career get the most out of their time and their lives.",

        "description": "Populist Authoritarianism f ocuses on the Chinese Communist Party, which governs the world's largest population in a single-party authoritarian state. Wenfang Tang attempts to explain the seemingly contradictory trends of the increasing number of protests on the one hand, and the results of public opinion surveys that consistently show strong government support on the other hand. The book points to the continuity from the CCP's revolutionary experiences to its current governing style, even though China has changed in many ways on the surface in the post-Mao era. The book proposes a theoretical framework of Populist Authoritarianism with six key elements, including the Mass Line ideology, accumulation of social capital, public political activism and contentious politics, a hyper-responsive government, weak political and civil institutions, and a high level of regime trust. These traits of Populist Authoritarianism are supported by empirical evidence drawn from multiple publicopinion surveys conducted from 1987 to 2015. Although the CCP currently enjoys strong public support, such a system is inherently vulnerable due to its institutional deficiency. Public opinion can swing violently due to policy failure and the up and down of a leader or an elite faction. The drastic change of public opinion cannot be filtered through political institutions such as elections and the rule of law, creating system-wide political earthquakes.",

How about an isolated milk factory that cannot get its milk to market? Or a pastry class training women to open caf\u00e9s on bombed-out streets without water or electricity?According to Peter Van Buren, we bought all these projects and more in the most expensive hearts-and-minds campaign since the Marshall Plan. We Meant Well is his eyewitness account of the civilian side of the surge--that surreal and bollixed attempt to defeat terrorism and win over Iraqis by reconstructing the world we had just destroyed. Leading a State Department Provincial Reconstruction Team on its quixotic mission, Van Buren details, with laser-like irony, his yearlong encounter with pointless projects, bureaucratic fumbling, overwhelmed soldiers, and oblivious administrators secluded in the world's largest embassy, who fail to realize that you can't rebuild a country without first picking up the trash.Darkly funny while deadly serious, We Meant Well is a tragicomic voyage of ineptitude and corruption that leaves its writer--and readers--appalled and disillusioned but wiser.",

The plays and shows that Nightingale crisply, authoritatively and readably brings alive range from Sheridan\u2019s School for Scandal to Tom Stoppard\u2019s Arcadia, from Gogol\u2019s Government Inspector to the Ian McKellen Macbeth, from Synge\u2019s Playboy of the Western World, which provoked serious riots in the Dublin of 1907, to Lionel Bart\u2019s Twang!! in 1965, possibly the most disastrous musical ever.Throughout the book Nightingale celebrates leading dramatists and performers, directors and composers. Everywhere he shares the fulfilment and fun he has found in the art-form he loves.",

When the townspeople of Lochdubh begin receiving poison pen letters, no one takes them very seriously, even if they are full of wild accusations. But Hamish fears that they might lead to something deadly. His instincts prove correct when the town's postmistress is found hanging from a rope with a poison pen letter at her feet. Though it appears to be a suicide, Hamish suspects something more sinister. Attempting to trace the letters, the last thing Hamish needs is any distractions, but soon Jenny Ogilvie arrives in Lochdubh determined to seduce him. Realizing that she is unable to take Hamish's mind off his case, Jenny decides to do a little investigating of her own. Now, Hamish finds himself in a race to solve the mystery of the poison pen letters before someone else dies, including one likely target-Jenny.",

He was obsessed with perfection and felt that everyone--from family members to his demanding patrons\u2014took advantage and let him down. His long and difficult association with Pope Julius II yielded his greatest masterpiece, the radiant paintings in the Sistine Chapel, and his most disastrous undertaking, the monumental tomb that caused the artist frustration and heartache for forty years.

In an extraordinary evocation of the legendary Old West, Wallis demonstrates why the Kid has remained one of our most popular folk heroes. Filled with dozens of rare images and period photographs, Billy the Kid separates myth from reality and presents an unforgettable portrait of this brief and violent life.",

        "description": "This is not the actual book Capital in the Twenty First Century by Thomas Piketty. Do not buy this if you are looking for a full copy of this book. TO OUR When it comes to book reviews, there is a difference between speaking out one\u2019s opinion and arranging a batch of negative reviews (for psychological or materialistic reasons). The arranged one- and two-star book reviews are typically posted within about one week. Then, they are up voted over the course of a few days so that they become the first thing readers see when they visit the book\u2019s page. We encourage our readers to be cautious when relying on such reviews. This is not the actual Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty First Century. The primary objective of this book is to bring insightful discussion and critique of Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty First Century to readers everywhere. This book includes a critique of Thomas Piketty\u2019s book, as well as the review of the future of economic inequality forecasted by other experts. Do not purchase this critique of the book if you are looking for a full copy of Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty First Century Income inequality in the United States and in Western Europe has been growing since the 1970s. In the US, the top 1 percent income share has more than doubled in the course of the last thirty years, drawing much public attention. In 2013, the thousand richest individuals in the UK had their wealth increased by 15 percent. At the same time, the UK government enacted a one percent pay freeze on public sector workers, re-enforcing the lengthiest wage squeeze since the 1870s. Modern capitalistic society is an unequal society, and that inequality grows fast due to the rich-get-richer trend. In his book, Piketty argues that as long as the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth, the income and wealth of the rich will grow faster than the typical income from work. This trend will continue to support rising economic inequality. In our critique of Piketty\u2019s Capital in the Twenty-First Century, we examine issues raised in Piketty\u2019s book, for the benefit of those who wish to read or study Piketty\u2019s book in the future. The critique includes summary and critical analysis of how Piketty\u2019s book treats a theory of capitalism and the issue of rising economic inequality.",

The Gillette-Brown murder case from which Dreiser drew his An American Tragedy was a sensation in its day. Newsman Craig Brandon has done a remarkable job of researching the case and the family backgrounds of the two principals and, is probably more familiar with the complete story than Dreiser ever was. Yet with all this information, this new treatment reads like a novel. Accompanied with over 100 photos, Murder in the Adirondacks sheds new light on what was a yellow journalist's delight in 1906. A must read for all Dreiser students.",

The last thing she wants to do is to fall in love with another baby parrot! But one look at the tiny grey ball of fluff and Shannon just knows\u2013he is love with wings, and they are meant to be together.A lifelong parrot lover but by no means experienced at caring for cockatiels, Shannon quickly assumes the role of eager student, with Pearl as her willing and equally eager teacher. From negotiating victuals preferences to socializing with the parrot-phobic, making home improvements to avoiding the dreaded V.E.T., Shannon learns from her feathery sidekick how to meet his basic needs, offer extra enrichment, nurture and care for him, and be nurtured and cared for in return.Pearl, in turn, opens a window for Shannon into a refreshing new world full of self-acceptance, self-respect, trust, laughter, love, and FUN. In Pearl\u2019s world, everyone is a potential new friend, every mirror reflects prettiness, every meal is a celebration of good food and good company, and each new day is a great day to celebrate being YOU.Today, 12 years after their first meeting, Shannon and Pearl are still blissfully joined at the beak. Love & Feathers, a book based on the popular blog by the same name, is their story.",

Arguing that every scientific concept and theory\u2014including his own\u2014is culturally conditioned, Fleck was appreciably ahead of his time. And as Kuhn observes in his foreword, \"Though much has occurred since its publication, it remains a brilliant and largely unexploited resource.\"\"To many scientists just as to many historians and philosophers of science facts are things that simply are the they are discovered through properly passive observation of natural reality. To such views Fleck replies that facts are invented, not discovered. Moreover, the appearance of scientific facts as discovered things is itself a social construction, a made thing. A work of transparent brilliance, one of the most significant contributions toward a thoroughly sociological account of scientific knowledge.\"\u2014Steven Shapin, Science",

        "description": "In his pioneering treatise on education the great French philosopher presented concepts that had a significant influence on the development of pedagogy, and yet many of his ideas still sound radical today. Written in reaction to the stultifying system of rote learning and memorization prevalent throughout Europe in Rousseau's time, Emile is a utopian vision of child-centered education, full of the sentiments of Romanticism, which Rousseau himself inspired.Imagining a typical boy named Emile, Rousseau creates an ideal model of one-on-one tutelage from infancy to manhood with himself as the child's mentor. \"Everything is good as it comes from the hands of the Author of Nature; but everything degenerates in the hands of man.\" This is the first of many provocative statements that characterize this work and are a hallmark of Rousseau's arresting rhetoric. As in so many of his other famous works, here too Rousseau asserts his main thesis that human beings by nature are good; it is only the distorting influences of civilization that have corrupted them.If this is true, then in educating children one must do nothing to interfere with human nature in its natural course. Far from being the chief means by which society inculcates its rules and principles, education should be the method of helping youths discover the inherent truths of their own human nature. From infancy to young adulthood learning should come purely from personal experience. Rather than imparting facts, teachers should foster self-discovery, so that knowledge is acquired through following innate curiosity, not vicariously through the statements of others.Educators as well as students of philosophy will find much to admire in Rousseau's original and still radical ideas.",

        "description": "Originally published in 1893 and never out of print, Emile Durkheim\u2019s groundbreaking work remains one of the cornerstone texts of the sociological canon\u2014now updated and re-translated in this new edition.As the Industrial Revolution was changing the landscape of society, Durkheim presented a new vision of the social structures at the root of capitalism, and the issues he grappled with still resound today. If pre-industrial societies were held together by common values, sentiments, and norms, equally shared by all, what holds modern societies, with their complex division of labor and non-cohesive social structure, together? What did this new social order mean for the autonomy of the individual? Durkheim argued that class conflict is not inherent in a capitalist society, as Marx contended, but that the unfettered growth of state power would lead to the extinction of individuality. Only in a free society that promotes voluntary bonds between its members, Durkheim suggested, can individuality prosper.In this new edition, the first since 1984, world-renowned Durkheim scholar Steven Lukes revisits and revises the original translation to enhance clarity, accuracy, and fluency for the contemporary reader. Lukes also highlights Durkheim\u2019s arguments by putting them into historical context with a timeline of important information. For students and scholars, this edition ofThe Division of Laboris essential reading and key to understanding the relevance of Durkheim\u2019s ideas today.",

        "description": "Emile is a philosophical treatise on education written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 18th century. The book is divided into five parts, each of which explores a different stage of a hypothetical boy's life and the education he should receive at that stage. In the first part, Rousseau discusses the importance of natural education and the role of the tutor in guiding the child's development. The second part focuses on the physical development of the child, including the importance of exercise and outdoor activities. The third part delves into the moral and intellectual education of the child, emphasizing the importance of cultivating a sense of morality and virtue in the child. The fourth part explores the role of religion in education, arguing that it should be based on natural religion rather than dogma. Finally, the fifth part discusses the education of women, arguing that they should receive an education that is equal to that of men. Throughout the book, Rousseau emphasizes the importance of allowing the child to develop naturally and avoiding the constraints of society and tradition. Emile is considered a groundbreaking work in the field of education and has had a significant impact on educational theory and practice. It has been praised for its emphasis on individualism and natural development, but also criticized for its rejection of traditional forms of education and its limited view of women's roles in society.Our inner conflicts are caused by these contradictions. Drawn this way by nature and that way by man, compelled to yield to both forces, we make a compromise and reach neither goal. We go through life, struggling and hesitating, and die before we have found peace, useless alike to ourselves and to others.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",

But what are the core issues and concerns, the ones that must be addressed if the church is to follow God\u2019s leading into the future? Laying aside what can be merely tweaked or adjusted, what must the UMC \u201creset\u201d about itself? Lovett Weems, one of the most highly-respected interpreters of contemporary United Methodism, suggests that we start with the- What will happen now that the increased giving that United Methodists have enjoyed (despite declining membership numbers) has reached a plateau and begun to decline?- Why, with 34,000 congregations and $6.5 billion in annual giving, can\u2019t United Methodists add a net increase of even 1 new disciple of Jesus Christ in a given year?- Why are United Methodist clergy less concerned with reaching young adults than are laity? Why are laity unwilling to make the changes to worship and budgets required to attract these same young adults?- If the percentage of married couples with young children has declined by half since the 1950s, why is that still the group we focus on reaching?- Why are so many mid-sized churches on their way to becoming small-membership congregations?With insight, conviction, and calm resolve, Lovett Weems challenges United Methodists not only to ask these hard questions, but to face up to the difficult decisions they require of us as we continue to seek God\u2019s will for our lives together.",

        "description": "Educational reform is one of the most critical issues facing our cities, but some cities are better at it than others. To explain why, this book relates education to politics, showing how the \"whole village\" can be mobilized to better educate tomorrow's citizens.City Schools and City Politics is based on an eleven-city NSF study of civic capacity and urban education. As participants in that study, the authors conducted research in three rustbelt cities that have lost much of their tax base and have legacies of machine politics. They analyzed the ways in which government, business, and community leaders create, or fail to create, civic support for public education, focusing on why certain cities show greater initiative than others in addressing these problems.The authors reveal that, of the cities examined, Pittsburgh has made the most strides in educational reform, followed by Boston, while St. Louis has consistently lagged behind. Their observations show that cross-sectorial coalitions are essential for bringing about change; that organizational arrangements in the business community and their relationship to local government affect whether there is the capacity to address school reform; that leadership is critical in bringing about change; and that municipal institutions and culture influence a city's ability to take action.Packed with empirical data and analysis, City Schools and City Politics demonstrates the citywide and long-term character of successful efforts to reform public schools, relating education to the priorities of municipal governments and describing the conditions under which reform becomes possible. It extends regime theory to public education and shows that education policy is inextricably linked with urban political life and is an issue of real concern to political science.",

        "description": "The field of mind-body medicine is plagued by wild claims that mislead patients and instil false hope. But as scientists in a range of fields uncover solid evidence that our minds influence our bodies far more profoundly than previously thought, there is now great promise too. In her eye-opening new book, Jo Marchant delves deep into the latest scientific research and asks: - Are those who turn to alternative medicine deluded, or are they on to something? - Can our thoughts, beliefs and emotions influence our physical health? - Can we train our brains to heal our bodies? CURE takes us on a remarkable journey and offers a new and thought-provoking view of what it means to be human.",

From the narratives of army life during the Second World War to the domestic scenes he wrote about so movingly in his final book, The Lost World , Jarrell's poems are marked throughout by a voice that could be astonishingly intimate or could open up to speak to our common humanity.

        "description": "The Woman Who Had Imagination, H.E. Bates\u2019s fourth volume of stories, first published in 1934 (Jonathan Cape), is a fascinating collection of contrasts. The stories combine elements of realism and poetry, beauty and ugliness, tenderness and irony. Graham Greene, writing in the Spectator, lauded the collection as \u201cthe first volume of Mr. Bates\u2019s maturity\u201d and Bates as \u201can artist of magnificent originality with a vitality quite unsuspected hitherto.\u201dThis is brilliantly demonstrated in the title story, \u201cThe Woman Who Had Imagination,\u201d the heart-rending story of an Italian woman, revealed through the casual meetings and conversations that take place on a day\u2019s outing of a country choir.The contrast between \u201cThe Waterfall,\u201d with its melancholy and grace, and the disturbing tensions in \u201cThe Brothers.\u201d emphasizes Bates\u2019s mastery of both the delicate and the disquieting. It is also in this collection that we are introduced to the much-loved comic narrator, Uncle Silas, in \u201cThe Lily,\u201d \u201cThe Wedding.\u201d and \u201cDeath of Uncle Silas.\u201dIn addition to the original collection this edition includes two extra stories. \u201cThe Country Doctor\u201d concerns a woman\u2019s grief on the death of her dearest friend. It was first published in the Fortnightly Review in 1931 with the title \u201cThe Country Sale,\u201d and later in the limited edition The Story Without an End and The Country Doctor (White Owl Press, 1932), and has not been reprinted since.\u201cThe Parrot\u201d chronicles a man, a marriage and the eponymous parrot, and has only previously been published in 1928 in T.P.\u2019s Weekly, founded by the radical MP, T.P.

Her household is ordered, her love life is pleasant, the weather is fine. And then a man from her past arrives at the door. It is Alan Lee from the carnival.

Hinemoa\u2014on a luxury cruise to New Zealand. She is carrying the Great Queen of Sapphires, the Maharani, as bait.There are shipboard romances, champagne cocktails, erotic photographers, jealous swains, mickey finns, jazz musicians, blackmail, and attempted murder, all before the thieves find out\u2014as have countless love-smitten men before them\u2014that where the glamorous and intelligent Phryne is concerned, resistance is futile.",

        "description": "The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge.Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a pi\u00f1ata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish.Michael Lewis's investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so brilliantly, sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, DC, we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations.",

One is the University, which maintains a population and a structure and now has time and resources to find out what happened to some of its students, sold as slaves, while the University was ruled by a despot. Bran assembles a group, including a very cautious thief, twin girls and the strong man Mill the Hill, as well as Swart, a brother of one of the lost slaves. They set out for their first mission by train, for a place now called The Rat's Town, where Bran meets a transmitting empath called Scathe, who joins the group as they go further; first to find the lightning maker, the Stormbringer and then, further still, to return to find that their minds are not their own, and that their very worst nightmares are becoming very real indeed.",

        "description": "\"A brilliant work of social archaeology....A major historical contribution.\"\u2015Adam Goodheart, The New York Times Book Review The nineteenth century was a golden age for those people known variously as sodomites, Uranians, monosexuals, and homosexuals. Long before Stonewall and Gay Pride, there was such a thing as gay culture, and it was recognized throughout Europe and America. Graham Robb, brilliant biographer of Balzac, Hugo, and Rimbaud, examines how homosexuals were treated by society and finds a tale of surprising tolerance. He describes the lives of gay men and women: how they discovered their sexuality and accepted or disguised it; how they came out; how they made contact with like-minded people. He also includes a fascinating investigation of the encrypted homosexuality of such famous nineteenth-century sleuths as Edgar Allan Poe's Auguste Dupin and Sherlock Holmes himself (with glances forward in time to Batman and J. Edgar Hoover). Finally, Strangers addresses crucial questions of gay culture, including the riddle of its relationship to religion: Why were homosexuals created with feelings that the Creator supposedly condemns? This is a landmark work, full of tolerant wisdom, fresh research, and surprises.31 illustrations",

        "description": "How Music Works is David Byrne\u2019s remarkable and buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. In it he explores how profoundly music is shaped by its time and place, and he explains how the advent of recording technology in the twentieth century forever changed our relationship to playing, performing, and listening to music.Acting as historian and anthropologist, raconteur and social scientist, he searches for patterns\u2014and shows how those patterns have affected his own work over the years with Talking Heads and his many collaborators, from Brian Eno to Caetano Veloso. Byrne sees music as part of a larger, almost Darwinian pattern of adaptations and responses to its cultural and physical context. His range is panoptic, taking us from Wagnerian opera houses to African villages, from his earliest high school reel-to-reel recordings to his latest work in a home music studio (and all the big studios in between).Touching on the joy, the physics, and even the business of making music, How Music Works is a brainy, irresistible adventure and an impassioned argument about music\u2019s liberating, life-affirming power.",

In this book, Keel leads the way into this mysterious realm, postulating that what we know--or, rather, think we know--about UFOs & their ilk is in need of serious reconsideration. The possibilities Keel has uncovered through his years of research are controversial, to say the least; what he has to say will undoubtedly infuriate or alienate (excuse the pun) many readers. This is most unfortunate, since Keel is only trying his best to make sense of what seems at times a senseless matter indeed, perpetuated by some eternally manipulative & elusive intelligence. If there was ever a \"must-read\" for anyone interested in the paranormal, occult etc., this must surely be it.--Michael Lubert",

        "description": "The second entry in the Boss MacTavin series is a stand-alone novel about the nation's greatest cold case. Here's another solid blend of mystery, humor and action, this time with a more settled and prosperous Boss.The Rock Meets Its Match in BossTime: a few years after Southern Scotch. Boss's business, Boss Corrections, is doing very well. And, though still based in Portland, he enjoys extended stays in San Francisco with his fiancee. His new case there should have been a breeze, a chance to spend time with Mai Lin. But when his rich, ditsy client is killed before he can even begin, he's in a quandary--because he's been paid. The Scot in him says Take the money and go, but his Southern sense of honor insists that her death be Corrected. He finds a link between her death and the murders of two elderly men months apart, a trail that leads to Alcatraz. The great escape of '62, he learns, was only the start of a tale of revenge spanning fifty years. And Boss finds himself with just three days to help an unknown killer find the final escapee--or his kidnapped fiancee will die.Trivia--Boss takes over the narrative reins in this book. And the difference in tone is made clear at the start: less Mickey Spillane than Dash' Hammett.--In a tribute to Richard Boone and Have Gun Will Travel, Boss now co-owns the King Richard Hotel in S.F. He stays there several times a year in a suite reserved for him. And at the end of this book he will move to The City, going wherever work takes him.--The focus remains on the qualities that made Paladin great, not the cool gimmicks that everyone steals: e.g. the all-black working gear. Boss works for both honor and money. He will be paid what he is owed, though he still take occasional cases for free. He enjoys good food, good company. He roars with laughter and can also weep.--The original title was Shark City: A Thriller with 3000 Teeth. The title's changed but, rest assured, at the end of this story those teeth will arrive.--Boss acquires two new associates: Estelle and Dirty Boy.Now load your Kindles...and let's Rock!",

        "description": "\u2018He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention\u2019. Pride and Prejudice , one of the most famous love stories of all time, has also proven itself as a treasured mainstay of the English literary canon. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighbourhood, the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity. Misconceptions and hasty judgements bring heartache and scandal, but eventually lead to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. It\u2019s almost impossible to open Pride and Prejudice without feeling the pressure of so many readers having known and loved this novel already. Will you fail the test - or will you love it too? As a story that celebrates more unflinchingly than any of Austen\u2019s other novels the happy meeting-of-true-minds, and one that has attracted the most fans over the centuries, Pride and Prejudice sets up an echo chamber of good feelings in which romantic love and the love of reading amplify each other.",

Onder Obama veranderde van het wettelijk toestaan van het homohuwelijk en marihuana tot het sluiten van duizenden kerken per jaar in een diep gelovig Amerika. De Amerikaanse economie blijft zich intussen vernieuwen. Onze wereld zou er anders uitzien zonder Apple, Facebook en Google. En bedrijven als AirBnB en Uber, die nu de wereld veroveren, komen ook uit Amerika. Maar veel bleef ook hetzelfde en de nieuwe president die in 2016 verkozen wordt, wacht een immense verbetering van de verhoudingen tussen blank en zwart, het verkleinen van de bizarre verschillen tussen arm en rijk en het aanpakken van het krankzinnige wapenbezit.

        "description": "Set at the dawn of America's environmental consciousness, late 1970's, early '80's, pretty Ellowyn Kelsey is a redneck girl living the pretty redneck life in rural Michigan, waiting for her husband to come around...Her self-imposed lobotomy ends when she shows up at the wrong time for a church picnic, meeting a bunch of birders instead. Watching a mating pair of bluebirds tending to one another causes something in her to break. Everyone recognizes what she's going through except her--the depth of her pain and emotion holds her captive. How can she be the last to know? She is indignant, hurt, has no idea how to process the emotional sideswipe. Her pain is expressed through the crazy narcissistic melodrama of youth, her reluctant unabashed accomplice is her best friend, Patty. Part II finds her experiencing yet another major loss. She finds refuge in nature making true her mother's prediction, a chasm may form between her new and old life, between she and Patty. As the narcissism of her youth wears off, she starts to care about something bigger than herself (God forbid!), her own planet. The \"rednecks and assorted white trash\" of her town waste no time labeling her as their own \"token environmental wacko\". A new guy shows up, heart in one hand, binoculars in the other...She meets Kate, one of the first female biologists to be hired by the Michigan Fish and Game Department. A trailblazer in a male-dominated profession, Kate has spent her life fighting to \"protect the environment\". It hasn't worked out too well. Kate's very angry. Who wants to end up like her? Accompanied by her faithful mutt, Ellie leaves Michigan to travel \"out west\" where her sister lives, resulting in some unexpected experiences: spirits in the desert, an accidental crusade against a development, geographically diverse sexual encounters. Then there are those amazing sandhill cranes (who is this guy in my tent?). Is this her way of dealing with her transformation, maybe loving someone again?Major influences: Ed Abbey, Tom Robbins, John Irving, Rachel Carson, T.C. Boyle, J.D. Salinger, Pam Houston, Kurt Vonnegut, many others.",

        "description": "Edmundo de Bettencourt nasceu no Funchal h\u00e1 cem anos. Apesar de nos ter deixado uma obra po\u00e9tica escassa, foi important\u00edssima a sua actividade cultural. Bettencourt foi um dos fundadores da revista presen\u00e7a a que deu nome e que posteriormente abandonaria com Torga e Branquinho da Fonseca. Paralelamente foi com o guitarrista Artur Paredes um dos principais subvertores do tradicional fado de Coimbra. Gra\u00e7as a eles, o fado de Coimbra, incorporando elementos da can\u00e7\u00e3o popular tradicional, evoluiria para a balada que teria posteriormente express\u00e3o maior na voz de Jos\u00e9 Afonso. Depois de abandonar Coimbra, Edmundo de Bettencourt vive definitivamente em Lisboa continuando a publicar irregularmente os seus poemas. Em 1963 publicou na Portug\u00e1lia Editora a sua obra completa. Herberto Helder escreve ent\u00e3o um pref\u00e1cio pol\u00e9mico e hist\u00f3rico pela original leitura da poesia portuguesa. Reconhece-se na poesia de Bettencourt originalidade imag\u00e9tica e mesmo pr\u00e9-surrealista. Mas nem por isso Edmundo de Bettencourt ganhou o prest\u00edgio do are\u00f3pago local. Ao comemorar os 100 anos do autor de Poemas Surdos, pretende-se revisitar a sua obra na maioria esgotada h\u00e1 d\u00e9cadas. Assim, a Ass\u00edrio & Alvim apresenta a nova edi\u00e7\u00e3o da sua obra ainda com a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o actualizada de Herberto Helder.",

All'osteria di Benito, dove si ferma per un bicchiere chiunque passi in paese, il cameriere marocchino Amdi spesso serve da bere a due avventori singolari: un geologo impegnato a studiare il territorio e un architetto inglese innamorato del posto, Bill Holmes, che insieme alla bella nipote Betty sta conducendo una ricerca sulle costruzioni religiose - edicole votive, maest\u00e0, oratori - di cui \u00e8 ricca quella parte di Appennino. Nel frattempo, per\u00f2, ha cominciato a piovere senza tregua, e l'acqua d\u00e0 non poco filo da torcere all'ispettore della forestale Marco Gherardini, che in paese chiamano \"Poiana\". La pioggia divora interi costoni della montagna portando con s\u00e9 strade, alberi e forse anche uomini, come a punirli per l'incuria sempre maggiore cui abbandonano la loro terra. A parte ci\u00f2, in paese tutto sembra tranquillo. Fino a che, proprio il giorno prima di andarsene, il geologo non sparisce misteriosamente. E dopo la sua scomparsa una serie di aggressioni turba la vita di Casedisopra. A indagare ufficialmente sui troppi misteri che si nascondono tra i ruderi della Casa-fortezza del Capitano e l'edicola con l'affresco di una Madonna incinta, tra l'agriturismo gestito da una stravagante signora e il Sasso Nero che racchiude un segreto, \u00e8 incaricato il giovane maresciallo dei carabinieri Barnaba. Ma molto presto Poiana dovr\u00e0 intervenire in prima persona, sia pure non ufficialmente. E ad aiutarlo, con la ruvidezza montanara che gli \u00e8 consueta ma anche con saggezza, sar\u00e0 chi conosce il territorio e sa leggere i segni con cui la montagna parla all'uomo: il mitico Ad\u00f9mas. Ma anche i fratelli Seivadghi, Fonso e Doardo, e il paese intero daranno, sia pure involontariamente, il loro contributo... Ancora una volta Guccini e Macchiavelli sanno evocare per noi i sapori e le emozioni pi\u00f9 intense delle loro montagne e ci conducono lungo i valichi appenninici, dal Quattrocento a oggi, fino a scoprire una verit\u00e0 sorprendente e pi\u00f9 che mai attuale. Un romanzo forte come le radici di un albero secolare, appassionante come un inseguimento nel bosco, coraggioso come chi sa guardare negli occhi la verit\u00e0.",

Now Inspector Roderick Alleyn must penetrate not only the mysteries of folklore but the secrets and sins of an eccentric group that includes a surly blacksmith, a domineering dowager, and a not-so-simple village idiot.From her first book in 1934 to her final volume just before her death in 1982, Ngaio Marsh's work has remained legendary and is often compared to that of Agatha Christie, Margery Allingham, and Dorothy L.

        "description": "Despite his brilliance, Paul Skoglund hasn't held a steady job for years, partly because of his Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder that forces his body into wild swings and to blurt out tragically inappropriate words. When his wealthy aunt asks him to take on the repairs of her magnificent hunting lodge, he is in no position to refuse. But inside the lodge lies a mystery involving disappearances and deaths that haunt the region. Meanwhile, Paul's ex-wife is using his condition to wrest away custody of their young son, but for Paul, nothing and no one is going to come between him and Mark. Then quickening events lead him deeper into his family's past, and as Paul faces the darker aspects of his own nature, he must brave the possibility that in saving those he loves, he might well destroy himself.",

As United Nations Space Administration (UNSA) sets out to make international, perhaps interplanetary, claims over this alien phenomenon, they realize the moon is hollow, and harbors some sinister concern for the survival of Earth.Two sets of explorers, one convicts sent from Nefra to set up gravitational transportation, the other astronauts from Earth, explore this new world, and interact in a way neither their respective powers had ever expected.This could be the beginning of interplanetary piracy and war, or it could be the beginning of reunion; or it could be just the beginning of the end.",

        "description": "Example in this ebookThose to whom the Life of Pascal and the Story of Port Royal are unknown, must be referred to works treating fully of the subject, since it were impossible to deal with them adequately within the limits of a preface. Sainte-Beuve's great work on Port Royal, especially the second and third volumes, and \"Port Royal,\" by Charles Beard, B.A., London, 1863, may best be consulted by any who require full, lucid, and singularly impartial information.But for such as, already acquainted with the time and the man, need a recapitulation of the more important facts, or for those who may find an outline map useful of the country they are to study in detail, a few words are here given.Blaise Pascal was born at Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne, on June 19, 1623. He sprung from a well-known legal family, many members of which had held lucrative and responsible positions. His father, Etienne Pascal, held the post of intendant, or provincial administrator, in Normandy, where, and at Paris previously, Pascal lived from the age of sixteen to that of twenty-five; almost wholly educated by his father on account of his precarious health. His mother died when he was eight years old. Etienne Pascal was a pious but stern person, and by no means disposed to entertain or allow any undue exaltation in religion, refusing as long as he lived to allow his daughter Jaqueline to take the veil. But he had the usual faiths and superstitions of his time, and believing that his son's ill-health arose from witchcraft, employed the old woman who was supposed to have caused the malady to remove it, by herbs culled before sunrise, and the expiatory death of a cat. This made a great impression on his son, who in the \"Thoughts\" employs an ingenious argument to prove that wonders wrought by the invocation of the devil are not, in the proper sense of the term, miracles. At any rate the counter-charm was incomplete, as the child's feeble health remained feeble to the end.Intellectually, Blaise Pascal grew rapidly to the stature and strength of a giant; his genius showing itself mainly in the direction of mathematics; at the age of fifteen his studies on conic sections were thought worthy to be read before the most scientific men of Paris, and in after years of agonizing pain mathematical research alone was able to calm him, and distract his mind from himself. His actual reading was at all times narrow, and his scholarship was not profound. In 1646, his father, having broken his thigh at Rouen, came under the influence of two members of the Jansenist school of thought at that place, who attended him in his illness, and from that time dated the more serious religious views of the family. Jaqueline was from the first deeply affected by the more rigorous opinions with which she came in contact. Forbidden to enter the cloister, she lived at home as austere a life as though she had been professed, but after her father's death won her brother's reluctant consent to take the veil at Port Royal, and became one of the strictest nuns of that rigid rule.To be continue in this ebook..................................................................................",

This much is true...It is the summer of '42, and FBI agent Joe Lucas has come to Cuba at the behest of the Director to keep an eye on Ernest Hemingway, who has recklessly decided to play spy in the Caribbean. Lucas has been instructed to somehow gain the great writer's trust and friendship, but all the agent's cool intellect and training has left him unprepared to withstand the human whirlwind known as \"Papa.\"Hemingway has assembled a spy ring that he calls the \"Crook Factory\"--including an American millionaire, a twelve-year-old Cuban orphan, a Spanish jai alai champion, a priest, and a fisherman, among others--to play a dangerous game of amateur espionage. Then, against all odds, Hemingway uncovers a critical piece of intelligence, and the game turns deadly for himself, Lucas, and for untold innocents.In \"THE CROOK FACTORY,\" Dan Simmons weaves an unforgettable tale of riveting suspense, peopled by larger-than-life characters who inhabit the sensual, intoxicating Cuban landscape of the 1940s. It is a novel of honor, passion, and deadly conspiracy.And it could very well have happened...Interestingly, about 75% of the stuff in this book actually happened. The remaining 25% adds an excellent spy story thatmay havehappened while still fitting all known/revealed facts about Hemingway and his friends in Cuba during WWII.",

        "description": "As monsters in popular media have evolved and grown more complex, so have those who take on the job of stalking and staking them. This book examines the evolution of the contemporary monster hunter from Bram Stoker\u2019s Abraham Van Helsing to today\u2019s non-traditional monster hunters such as Blade, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Watchmen. Critically surveying a diverse range of books, films, television shows, and graphic novels, this study reveals how the monster hunter began as a white, upper-class, educated male and became everything from a vampire to a teenage girl with supernatural powers. Now often resembling the monsters they\u2019ve vowed to conquer, modern characters occupy a gray area where the battle is often with their own inner natures as much as with the \u201cevil\u201d they fight.",

        "description": "Life of Ai: The artist activistAs his personal circumstances move in constant flux, Ai Weiwei remains a cultural magnet. Renowned for his political activism and social media activity almost as much as for his social interventions, contemporary approach to the readymade, and knowledge of Chinese traditional crafts, Ai s fame extends throughout and beyond the art world.Drawn from TASCHEN s limited Collector s Edition, this monograph explores each of Ai s career phases up until his release from Chinese custody. It features extensive visual material to trace Ai s development from his early New York days right through to his recent practice. Focus moments include his international breakthrough in the early 2000s, his porcelain Sunflower Seeds at the Turbine Hall of the Tate Modern, his response to the Sichuan earthquake of 2008, and his police detention in 2011. With behind-the-scenes studio pictures, production shots, and numerous statements derived from exclusive interviews with Ai, we gain privileged access to the artist s process, influences, and importance.The book includes texts from Uli Sigg, Ai s longtime friend and former Swiss ambassador to China; Roger M. Buergel, who curated the 2007 documentary and hosted the artist s Fairytale piece; and experts on Chinese culture and politics: Carlos Rojas, William A. Callahan, and James J. Lally.Text in English, French, and German\"",

His earlier volume, The Monster in the Mirror (2006), contained a treasury of essays that displayed Waugh's exhaustive knowledge of Lovecraft's work and his skill in placing Lovecraft in a broader literary context. This new collection of essays cements Waugh's reputation as a pioneering Lovecraft scholar. Among the contributions are studies of the influence of World War I on \"The Rats in the Walls\"; Lovecraft's relationship to his two late colleagues, Robert Bloch and Fritz Leiber, as well as to such other writers as D. H. Lawrence, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Eugene O'Neill; the influence of Roman literature and history on Lovecraft; and the sublimated eroticism of \"The Thing on the Doorstep\" and \"Medusa's Coil.\" All in all, this volume, containing several previously unpublished essays, displays the inexhaustible depths of Lovecraft's writing and Robert H. Waugh's deftness in probing its intricacies.",

The two men\u2014intelligent and bold\u2014typified the Belle \u00c9poque, a period of immense scientific achievement and fascination with science\u2019s promise to reveal the secrets of the human condition. With high drama and stunning detail, Douglas Starr revisits Vacher\u2019s infamous crime wave, interweaving the story of how Lacassagne and his colleagues were developing forensic science as we know it. We see one of the earliest uses of criminal profiling, as Fourquet painstakingly collects eyewitness accounts and constructs a map of Vacher\u2019s crimes. We follow the tense and exciting events leading to the murderer\u2019s arrest. And we witness the twists and turns of the trial, celebrated in its day. In an attempt to disprove Vacher\u2019s defense by reason of insanity, Fourquet recruits Lacassagne, who in the previous decades had revolutionized criminal science by refining the use of blood-spatter evidence, systematizing the autopsy, and doing groundbreaking research in psychology. Lacassagne\u2019s efforts lead to a gripping courtroom denouement. The Killer of Little Shepherds is an important contribution to the history of criminal justice, impressively researched and thrillingly told.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "description": "\"The fish's streamlined shape reveals functional knowledge ofthe physical properties of water.... The deadly effectiveness of the cobra's venom shows useful knowledge of the physiology of its prey.... Indeed, knowledge itself may be broadly conceived as the fit of some aspect of an organism to some aspect of its environment, whether it be the fit of the butterfly's long siphon of a mouth to theflowers from which it feeds or the fit of the astrophysicist's theories to the structure of the universe.... But how did such remarkable instances of fit arise? How did the animate world obtain its impressive knowledge of its surroundings? And how do organismscontinue to acquire knowledge and thereby increase their fit during their lifetimes?\" In this sweeping account of the emergence of fit, Gary Cziko integrates numerous scientific disciplines within the perspective of a universal selection theory that attempts to account for all cases of fit involving living organisms, including those that might appear miraculous. Cziko's bold assertion is that all novel forms of adapted complexity\u2014whether single-celled organisms or scientific theories\u2014emerge from an evolutionary process involving cumulative blind variation and selection. Without Miracles describes many remarkable examples of the fit of various structures, behaviors, and products of living organisms to their environments in a broad synthesis of humankind's attempt to understand the emergence of complex, adapted entities. These explanations range from the providential accounts of the early philosophers and \"natural theologians,\" through instructionist theories of the type proposed by Lamarck, to an ongoing \"second Darwinian revolution\" in which natural and artificial selection are being applied to many fields of science to both explain the emergence of naturally occurring adapted complexity and to facilitate the design of useful products ranging from microbes to computer programs. The evolution of explanations of fit from providential through instructionist to selectionist theories, Cziko argues, has occurred repeatedly in many different fields of knowledge along with a growing realization that the Darwinian mechanism of cumulative blind variation and selection is the only tenable nonmiraculous explanation for the emergence of any kind of functional complexity. Cziko applies this provocative selectionist thesis to a stunning range of domains including biology, immunology, neuroscience, ethology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, education, linguistics, and computer science. The result is an up-to-date, clearly summarized collection of selectionist arguments that shows how our knowledge of the emergence of fit has itself evolved and continues to do so. A Bradford Book",

        "description": "SPOIL OF WAR is a fascinating account of early Britain, a gripping tale of lust, love and the horrors of ancient warfare. Beautifully written, filled with myriad period details and compelling characters, it takes you deep into the heart of a brutal era -- and into the nature of feminine honor, feminine courage. I was enthralled. - JENNIFER BLAKE, NY Times Bestselling Author__________Elsbeth of Olmsbury desires nothing beyond helping her father run his dukedom - until the duke's forces are overwhelmed, his castle torched and Elsbeth seized for the invading king's personal spoil. Expecting the same abuse as the other surviving women of her house, Elsbeth instead finds the king, Leodegrance, treating her with a civility that belies his flagrant desire for her. A desire that will have her his consort in Cameliard once he can convince her rank and duty alone forced his hand against her father.But Elsbeth is not so easily won. There is the matter of Leodegrance gifting his steward with an unwilling young handmaid from Elsbeth's household. Of his marriage of convenience to his Byzantine queen. And of his plans to subjugate more of Britain's citadels and unite the wild isle under Roman rule.If Elsbeth can't find her tangled way to forgiveness with the king - or escape the dark designs and perverse desires of Uther Pendragon, enemy to them both - then a legend of Camelot may never be conceived, never be born, and never change history forever ...__________Please This novel takes place in a harsh era when spoils were often treated as commodities. While the violence toward women and children is period-appropriate and for mature adults only, it is never gratuitous. The story focuses on adaptation, survival and, ultimately, love in the Dark Ages before Arthur was made king.",

A Cambridge educated Anglo-Indian, Edward Pritchard Gee took up employment on the tea estates of Assam in the midst of thick forests. All his holidays and leisure time was dedicated to travel and photography. He travelled to all the major wildlife sanctuaries and forests of India, clicking photographs! This is about his travels, people he met, animals he saw. Up close. The majestic gaurs of Bandipur. The charging rhinos of Kaziranga. The impressive elephant herds of Periyar. The unforgettable lions of Gir. The schools of barasinghas at Kanha. The golden langurs that he did not discover! The wild asses he chased in the Rann in open jeep. Of his many pets some of which ended up as celebrities in international zoos. His style of narration is easy paced, relaxed. He takes you for all those wildlife adventure trips that you somehow could never manage to take. You travel on train. On jeep. On elephant back. On boat. You will miss nothing! He talks of the early efforts at conservation \u2013 the foresters and the naturalists he encountered. Of his surveys to estimate populations of wildlife \u2013 the country\u2019s earliest efforts at animal census. He talks of his simple ideas to manage wildlife. E.P. settled down with his pets at Shillong after his retirement to grow orchids and to pursue his hobbies with a greater vigour. The book is an enjoyable read. The foreword has been written by Jawaharlal Nehru! The flavour is much like that of Enid Blyton\u2019s fairy tales for children.E.P. makes you experience the charm of wilderness \u2013 those enchanted woods \u2013 without trying too hard. And to make you wish that the story of India\u2019s struggle to save its wildlife gets a fairy tale end.",

Armand de Valois was one of these latter unfortunates, stricken by yellow fever at the site of his ruin. When his widow Odette disappears into his tomb in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery and never returns, her maid Denise fears the worst. Alone in the great metropolis, Denise knows just one person she can go to for Odette's former lover, Victor Legris. When the frightened girl turns up at his bookshop, Victor feels there must be a simple explanation for Odette's disappearance.But it soon becomes apparent that something sinister lies behind events at the P\u00e8re-Lachaise. When Denise turns up drowned in the Seine, and Odette's corpse is found buried in an overgrown backyard, Victor throws himself into his second investigation, aided by his trusty assistant Joseph and much to his lover Tasha's chagrin.Once again, Paris and its denizens come alive, and events of world and local history give the mystery a thrilling backdrop. From the the Bois de Vincennes to the streets of Saint-Germain, from trams to carriages, from artists' lofts to coffee bars, diligently researched and tightly plotted, The Disappearance at P\u00e8re-Lachaise immerses readers in a fascinating mystery in the glorious City of Light.",

        "description": "In the Duchy of Oc, the most precious of creatures are the winged horses blessed by the goddess Kalla. When one is born, it is immediately taken to the Academy of Air to be trained and watched over. But this time, the Academy is getting more than it bargained for. \u00a0 At Deeping Farm, far in the Uplands, young Larkyn Hamley finds a lone winged horse, starving, exhausted, and about to give birth. The headstrong Larkyn saves the newborn from death. But in the process, the coal-black foal named Tup bonds with Lark\u2014which the horses only do with one human woman, and for life. \u00a0 So when Mistress Phillipa Winter arrives to inspect Tup, she has little choice but to take the farm girl to the Academy for a \u201cproper\u201d education. There, Lark realizes that her unlikely good fortune may not be so lucky. For in the elite world of the Academy, Lark\u2019s kindness and honesty prove to be weak armor against the taunts and cruelty of the high-born girls already there. \u00a0 Now, with Tup as her only ally, Larkyn Hamley is going to show everyone how high she can fly. Because if she falls, it\u2019s a long, long way down.",

        "description": "A woman commits suicide for no apparent reason. A week later, her son \u2013 fifteen-year-old Mark Underhill \u2013 vanishes. His uncle, novelist Timothy Underhill, searches his hometown of Millhaven for clues that might help unravel this horrible dual mystery. He soon learns that a pedophilic murderer is on the loose in the vicinity, and that shortly before his mother\u2019s suicide, Mark had become obsessed with an abandoned house where he imagined the killer might have taken refuge. No mere empty building, the house whispers from attic to basement with the echoes of a long-hidden true-life horror story, and Tim Underhill comes to fear that in investigating its unspeakable history, Mark stumbled across its last and greatest secret: a ghostly lost girl who may have coaxed the needy, suggestible boy into her mysterious domain.",

This daughter of a classics scholar has other selves that are no mere they include Nemesis, Pandora, the Fates, Cronos, Eris, and Eurydice - and one frightened five-year-old child. Holly is a beautiful and talented artist whose only sanctuary is her art. But now her gallery owner has been murdered and her body left in a garden surrounded by Holly's sculptures. The horror is that Holly doesn't know where she was when the killing occurred. She doesn't know whether she witnessed a murder or even committed one that night. In fact, she's not even certain who she was when the killing occurred.When Detective Orson Cheever was assigned to investigate the murder of gallery owner Bonnie Gill, the gods were not smiling. He's spent the last twenty years solving the bloody puzzles that murderers leave behind. His intelligence and the facts. This time, faced with a woman who is a little girl one minute, Cronos, the murderous father of the gods the next, and all three Fates in one body the minute after that, he realizes that he is going to have to find a new way to work. A way that will allow him to blindly feel his way between past and present, between myth and reality. He also knows that he will have to solve the too human puzzle that is Holly before he can even begin to know who killed Bonnie Gill.",

Malah lucu serta gemas saat dikenang.Sebenarnya, apakah pengorbanan memiliki harga dan batasan?

        "description": "A touching and provocative collection of memories that evoke the history of one of America's most influential boroughs-the Bronx-through some of its many success storiesThe vivid oral histories in Arlene Alda'sJust Kids from the Bronxreveal what it was like to grow up in the place that bred the influencers in just about every field of endeavor. The Bronx is where Michael Kay, the New York Yankees' play-by-play broadcaster, first experienced baseball; where J. Crew's CEO Millard (\"Mickey\") Drexler found his ambition; where Neil deGrasse Tyson and Dava Sobel fell in love with science; and where local music making inspired singer-songwriter Dion DiMucci and hip-hop's Grandmaster Melle Mel.The parks, the pickup games, the tough and tender mothers, the politics, the gangs, the food-for people who grew up in the Bronx, childhood recollections are fresh. Arlene Alda's own Bronx memories were a jumping-off point from which to reminisce with a nun, a police officer, an urban planner, and with Al Pacino, Carl Reiner, Colin Powell, Maira Kalman, Bobby Bonilla, Mary Higgins Clark, and many other leading artists, athletes, scientists, and entrepreneurs-experiences spanning six decades of Bronx living. Alda then arranged these pieces of the past, from looking for violets along the banks of the Bronx River to the wake-up calls from teachers who recognized potential, into one great collective story, a filmlike portrait of the Bronx from the early twentieth century until today.",

        "description": "From Italy to the Indian Ocean, from Japan to Honduras, a far-reaching examination of the perils of American military bases overseasAmerican military bases encircle the globe. More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the U.S. still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon\u2019s vast operations. But in an eye-opening account,Base Nationshows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills\u2014and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run.As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the U.S. into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories like Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine\u2019s accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year.For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the U.S. withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy.Base Nationis an essential contribution to that debate.",

In each of these stories Alby distills the anguish, the terror, the humor, and the strange grace\u2014or lack of\u2014he experiences in the aftermath of his mother's death. Swirling at the center of Alby's rage is a grief so big, so profound, it might swallow him whole. As he drinks, screws, and jokes his way through his pain and heartache, Alby's anger, his kindness, and his capacity for good bubble up when he (and we) least expect it. Sumell delivers \"a naked rendering of a heart sorting through its broken pieces to survive.*\"Making Niceis a powerful, full-steam-ahead ride that will keep you laughing even as you try to catch your breath; a new classic about love, loss, and the fine line between grappling through grief and fighting for (and with) the only family you've got.*Mark Richard",

        "description": "A cheeky, charming debut about twentysomething best friends in London navigating their careers and love lives past post-collegiate turmoil and into adulthood with lots of pints along the way.Emma is a rising star at the marketing firm she works at as a \"creative,\" but would have trouble describing what exactly it is she does all day. She pours most of her actual creative energy into a popular blog that all of her friends agree is brilliant, but she has yet to make a cent on it. Clem is a massively talented screenwriter just back from New York, where she picked up a fancy graduate degree in film. But until she convinces an agent to take on her masterpiece script, she's stuck hostessing at the bar she frequented as an undergrad, and the only calls she's getting are about bills past due and overdrawn bank accounts. In their ironclad friendship both girls find a reliable break from the post-collegiate absurdities and indignities that seem to abound in life right at the moment they feel they should finally be getting it all together.With a rotating cast of lovably insufferable friends, from Emma's fabulous DJ and ladies man roommate to Clem's painfully ordinary and predictable childhood chum, the girls wind their way through the twists and turns of aging parents and terrible bosses and regrettable one night stands, unforeseen setbacks and blessings that present as anything but, and remind each other that while their ships might not have come in yet, the after work drinks are cold and the company can't be beat.",

        "description": "The glory of the Leibstandarte SS Adolph Hitler was their ambition even if death was the price - and of the of the 30,000 SS soldiers who signed up with this elite force only thirty would survive the war. Some perished in the abortive push on Normandy directed by the Fuhrer. Others suffered gruesome deaths in the hands of the Russians. But wherever they went they left a trail of terror as they butchered their way across Europe. In a chilling day-by-day account of the final year of this crack squad, Charles Whiting chronicles their bloody demise which culminated in humiliation at the Battle of the Bulge. CHARLES WHITING, the author, is Britain's most prolific military writer with over 250 books to his credit. He saw active service in the Second World War, serving in an armoured reconnaissance regiment attached to both the US and British Armies. He is therefore able to write with the insight and authority of someone who, as a combat soldier, actually experienced the horrors of World War II.",

        "description": "A crisis is looming for baby boomers and anyone else who hopes to retire in the coming years. In When I'm Sixty-Four , Teresa Ghilarducci, the nation's leading authority on the economics of retirement, explains how to confront this crisis head-on, revealing the causes behind the increasingly precarious economics of old age in America and proposing a bold plan to guarantee retirement security for every working citizen.Retirement is one of the hallmarks of a prosperous, civilized market economy. Yet in America today Social Security is on the ropes. Government and employers are dismantling pension security, forcing older people to work longer. The federal government spends billions in exemptions for 401(k)s and other voluntary retirement accounts, yet retirement savings for most workers is falling. Ghilarducci takes an unflinching look at the eroding economic structure of retirement in America--and what she finds is alarming. She exposes the failures of pension regulators and the false hopes of privatized Social Security. She tells the ugly truth about risky 401(k) plans, do-it-yourself retirement schemes, and companies like Enron that have left employees without any retirement savings. Ghilarducci puts forward a sweeping plan to revive the retirement-income system, a plan that will ensure that, after forty years of work, every American will receive 70 percent of their preretirement earnings, guaranteed for life. No other book makes such a persuasive case for overhauling the pension and Social Security system in order to provide older Americans with the financial stability they have earned and deserve.",

        "description": "Jason returns with more tales of love and loss among the dog- and cat-headed. Another all-original collection of full-color graphic novellas in the format of Low Moon, Athos in America takes its title from the lead story, a prequel of sorts to the graphic novel The Last Musketeer , in which the seemingly ageless swashbuckler turns up in a bar in 1920 New York and relates the tale of how he went to Hollywood to play himself in a film version of The Three Musketeers . Another tie-in with a previous Jason story occurs in \u201cThe Smiling Horse,\u201d in which the characters from the story \u201c&\u201d in Low Moon attempt to kidnap a woman.Also in this volume: \u201cThe Brain That Wouldn\u2019t Virginia Woolf,\u201d a mash-up of The Brain That Wouldn\u2019t Die and Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf , told in reverse chronological order; the Bukowski pastiche \u201cA Cat From Heaven\u201d in which Jason works on his comic, has a reading in a comic book store, gets drunk and makes a fool of himself; the dialogue-free (all the text occurs in thought balloons) \u201cTom Waits on the Moon,\u201d in which we follow four people (one of them a scientist working on a teleportation machine) until something goes wrong; and \u201cSo Long Mary Ann,\u201d a prison-escape love-triangle story. 200 pages of full-color comics",

Now she is a Spoken Word artist and the top act for Warriors of Light Records. But come nightfall, she hunts vampires and demons\u2014predators that people tend to dismiss as myth or fantasy. But Damali and her Guardian team cannot afford such delusions, especially now, when a group of rogue vampires have been killing the artists of Warriors of Light and their rival, Blood Music. Strange attacks have also erupted within the club drug-trafficking network and drawn the attention of the police. These killings are a bit out of the ordinary, even for vampires. No neat puncture marks in the neck to show where the life's blood has been sucked from the body. These bodies have been mutilated beyond recognition, indicating a blood lust and thirst for destruction that surpasses any Damali has encountered before. Damali soon discovers that behind these brutal murders is the most powerful vampire she has ever met, and this seductive beast is coming for her next. But his unholy intentions have also drawn the focus of other hellish dark forces. Soon Damali finds herself being pulled deeper into the vast and horrifying vampire world.",

        "description": "From the first edition of The Fannie Farmer Cookbook to the latest works by today's celebrity chefs, cookbooks reflect more than just passing culinary fads. As historical artifacts, they offer a unique perspective on the cultures that produced them. In Manly Meals and Mom's Home Cooking , Jessamyn Neuhaus offers a perceptive and piquant analysis of the tone and content of American cookbooks published between the 1790s and the 1960s, adroitly uncovering the cultural assumptions and anxieties\u2015particularly about women and domesticity\u2015they contain. Neuhaus's in-depth survey of these cookbooks questions the supposedly straightforward lessons about food preparation they imparted. While she finds that cookbooks aimed to make readers\u2015mainly white, middle-class women\u2015into effective, modern-age homemakers who saw joy, not drudgery, in their domestic tasks, she notes that the phenomenal popularity of Peg Bracken's 1960 cookbook, The I Hate to Cook Book , attests to the limitations of this kind of indoctrination. At the same time, she explores the proliferation of bachelor cookbooks aimed at \"the man in the kitchen\" and the biases they display about male and female abilities, tastes, and responsibilities. Neuhaus also addresses the impact of World War II rationing on homefront cuisine; the introduction of new culinary technologies, gourmet sensibilities, and ethnic foods into American kitchens; and developments in the cookbook industry since the 1960s. More than a history of the cookbook, Manly Meals and Mom's Home Cooking provides an absorbing and enlightening account of gender and food in modern America.",

        "description": "In 1970 Doug and Gloria Bates adopted a 4 year old black girl as a sister to their 2 biological white sons. 2 years later they adopted another black girl. GIFT CHILDREN is the story of the 23 year interracial journey that ensued, a story that helps illuminate race relations in America today while depicting both the harsh difficulties as well as the heartwarming rewards that followed. GIFT CHILDREN is an intimate portrait of race relations told through the history of the Bates family. It is a deeply American story about bringing up children (in this case, in Eugene, Oregon), about celebrating and growing together, about coping with family tensions and dilemmas, and about negotiating the difficult years of adolescence and young adulthood. While casting a sharp light on the racism that lies all about us--and often within us as well--it is preeminently a book about caring, trusting, loving, and working together. GIFT CHILDREN describes the problems, setbacks, and pain of a family's attempt to live interracially, but ultimately it tells of a signal success hard won in an imperfect world. All who are interested in families, adoption, and race relations in America will find GIFT CHILDREN an important and moving book.",

        "description": "What is the nature of life? Scientists turn to natural selection, genes or adaptation to explain the living world, but the imagery of evolution threatens to distort our understanding of the incredible history of our planet. There is no science without mythology, and the only way to reveal the facts is to understand the fictions.The Mythology of Evolution exposes seven 'spins' given to evolutionary theory, each resting upon an ideological interpretation of an otherwise neutral idea. There are myths of progress and destiny, such as the \u2018ladder of progress\u2019 and \u2018only the strong survive\u2019. There are stories magnifying the significance of genes such as \u2018the selfish gene\u2019 or \u2018kin selection\u2019. There are more grandiose myths such as \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 and the infamous \u2018intelligent design\u2019. All relate to a final myth \u2013 that of \u2018science as truth\u2019.By liberating evolution from these misrepresentative stories, we can find a more nuanced vision of life that shows how advantages persist, trust is beneficial, and the diversity of species emerges from a refinement of possibilities made possible by a chain of inheritance that stretches back to the beginnings of life itself.",

An early proponent of African unity and independence, Haile Selassie, who claimed to be a descendant of King Solomon, fought with the Allies against the Axis powers during World War II and was a messianic figure for the Jamaican Rastafarians. Written by Asfa-Wossen Asserate, Haile Selassie\u2019s grandnephew, this is the first major biography on this final \u201cking of kings.\u201dAsserate introduces Haile Selassie as a reformer and an autocrat whose personal history\u2014with all of its upheavals, promises, and horrors\u2014reflects in many ways the history of the twentieth century itself. Chosen asTime\u2019s \u201cMan of the Year\u201d in 1936 for resisting Mussolini\u2019s invasion of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie was celebrated by many as the anti-colonialist \u201cfather of Africa.\u201d But the final years of his empire saw turmoil and revolution, and he was ultimately overthrown and assassinated in a communist coup.Asserate, who spent his childhood and adolescence in Ethiopia before fleeing the revolution of 1974, knew Haile Selassie personally and gained intimate insights into life at the imperial court. Using his own personal experiences and painstaking research in family and public archives, Asserate has achieved a colorful and even-handed portrait of the emperor and his tumultuous reign.",

Pero en el testamento hab\u00eda una cl\u00e1usula: Adela, la viuda, ten\u00eda que mantener de por vida a su cu\u00f1ado Smedley Cork, un petimetre acostumbrado a la buena vida y a no pegar golpe. Claro est\u00e1 que la idea que Adela y Smedley ten\u00edan sobre esta manutenci\u00f3n era muy diferente. Para la ex actriz, significaba una habitaci\u00f3n en su propia casa, tres comidas por d\u00eda, y yogur, mucho yogur, en lugar de los c\u00f3cteles a los que elbon vivantestaba acostumbrado. Smedley, por su parte, pensaba que Adela estaba moralmente obligada a instalarlo en un apartamento en Park Avenue, y a poner a su disposici\u00f3n una bien provista cuenta bancaria. Como la frugal viuda se manten\u00eda en sus trece, Smedley urdi\u00f3 un plan para conseguir la fortuna que se merec\u00eda por sus refinados apetitos. Y en ese plan ocupaba un lugar destacado el diario de una volc\u00e1nica actriz muerta en un accidente de aviaci\u00f3n.En esta ocasi\u00f3n, Hollywood es el territorio elegido por Wodehouse para desplegar su desternillante humor, su desopilante sentido del absurdo. Una ciudad enloquecida donde toda locura es posible. P.G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) naci\u00f3 en Surrey. Tras trabajar un tiempo como periodista en Inglaterra, se traslado a los Estados Unidos, donde se dedic\u00f3 por entero a la literatura. Escribi\u00f3 numerosas obras de teatro y comedias musicales, y m\u00e1s de noventa novelas, situadas la mayor\u00eda en la Inglaterra de los a\u00f1os veinte. Creador de personajes inolvidables -Jeeves, Bertie Wooster, su t\u00eda Agatha, Ukridge, Psmith, Lord Emsworth, los lechuguinos del Club de los Zanganos, y tantos otros-, sus obras han sido traducidas a numerosos idiomas y se reeditan continuamente, como corresponde a uno de los grandes humoristas del siglo, un cl\u00e1sico indiscutible.En esta colecci\u00f3n se han publicado las siguientes obras de Wodehouse:El inimitable Jeeves,De acuerdo, Jeeves,Ola de cr\u00edmenes en el castillo de Blandings.",

        "description": "The USS Essex, a thirty-two gun frigate built in 1799 by the merchants of Salem, was known around the world for her speed and graceful lines, achieving a brilliant series of dramatic firsts for the young American Navy.She became the first U.S. war ship to round the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian Ocean. Thirteen years later, the Essex became the first American man-of-war to round the Horn into the Pacific, where her crew fought-and lost-one of the bloodiest sea battles in U.S. History. A list of her commanders-Edward Preble, William Bainbridge, James Barron, and David Porter-reads like a who's who of the early American Navy. David Farragut served as a midshipman before achieving fame as the first rear admiral of the US Navy.The Essex's most important role, however was in promoting and protecting the interests of the United States throughout the world. By the late 1790s, the young country was emerging from its colonial dependence on Europe into a global commercial presence and a budding world power in its own right. Its future growth depended on international trade, and that trade depended, in turn, on unimpeded access to the sea.The history of the Essex is both a stirring nautical adventure and an engaging look at an important turning point in the history of the young American nation.",

        "description": "NATIONAL BESTSELLER \u2022\u00a0The author of the runaway bestseller How the Irish Saved Civilization takes us on another \"captivating...persuasive as well as entertaining\" journey into history ( The New York Times) , recreating a time when the actions of a small band of people had repercussions that are still felt today.The Gifts of the Jews reveals the critical change that made western civilization possible. Within the matrix of ancient religions and philosophies, life was seen as part of an endless cycle of birth and death; time was like a wheel, spinning ceaselessly. Yet somehow, the ancient Jews began to see time differently. For them, time had a beginning and an end; it was a narrative, whose triumphant conclusion would come in the future. From this insight came a new conception of men and women as individuals with unique destinies--a conception that would inform the Declaration of Independence--and our hopeful belief in progress and the sense that tomorrow can be better than today. As Thomas Cahill narrates this momentous shift, he also explains the real significance of such Biblical figures as Abraham and Sarah, Moses and the Pharaoh, Joshua, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.Full of compelling stories, insights and humor, The Gifts of the Jews is an irresistible exploration of history as fascinating and fun as How the Irish Saved Civilization.",

        "description": "On the campus of the University of Tennessee lies a patch of ground unlike any in the world. The \"Body Farm\" is a place where human corpses are left to the elements, and every manner of decay is fully explored -- for the sake of science and the cause of justice. The scientist who created the Body Farm has broken cold cases and revolutionized forensics, and now, in this heart-stopping novel, he spins an astonishing tale inspired by his own experiences.A woman's corpse lies hidden in a cave in the mountains of East Tennessee. Undiscovered for thirty years, her body has been transformed by the cave's chemistry into a near-perfect mummy -- one that discloses an explosive secret to renowned anthropologist Bill Brockton. Dr. Brockton has spent his career surrounded by death and decay at the Body Farm, but even he is baffled by this case unfolding in a unique environment where nothing is quite what it seems.The surreal setting is Cooke County, a remote mountain community that's clannish, insular, and distrustful of outsiders. The heartbreaking discovery of the young woman's corpse reopens old wounds and rekindles feuds dating back decades. The county's powerful and uncooperative sheriff and his inept deputy threaten to derail Brockton's investigation altogether. So do Brockton's other nemeses: his lingering guilt over the death of his wife, and the fury of a medical examiner whom Brockton dares to oppose in court.Carved in Boneis a richly atmospheric, superbly suspenseful, and magnificently rendered trip into the world of forensic science, the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, and the dark passageways of the human psyche. Full of vivid characters and startling twists and turns, this thrilling novel heralds the debut of a major new voice in crime fiction -- and an unforgettable work from the hand of a scientific legend.",

        "description": "The story of a young boy who escaped Hitler and the Holocaust\u2014and lived happily ever after.Escaping Hitler is the true story, covering ninety years, of G\u00fcnter Stern who, at fourteen, when Adolf Hitler threatened his family, education, and future, resolved to escape from his rural village of Nickenich in the German Rhineland. In July 1939, G\u00fcnter boarded a bus to the border of Luxembourg, illegally crossed the river, and walked alone for seven days through Belgium and into Holland. He was intent on catching a ferry to England and freedom, but the outcome of his journey was not exactly as he had planned.Scrivens gathered her information through interviews with G\u00fcnter, now known as Joe Stirling, and with those closest to him. During an emotional \u2018foot-stepping\u2019 journey in September 2013, Scrivens also visited G\u00fcnter\u2019s birthplace, met with a school friend, discovered the apartment in Koblenz where he fled following Kristallnacht in 1938, drove the route of G\u00fcnter\u2019s walk through Europe, and retraced the final steps of his parents prior to their deportation to a Nazi death camp in Poland during 1942.Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Arcade, Good Books, Sports Publishing, and Yucca imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs.

        "description": "Not to be confused with the Common Core itself \u2013 which has no science behind it - this book screams research. If one is looking for a go-to, desk-check reference for literally every topic beneath the Common Core umbrella, this book comes close. While some school reform critics engage in sweeping generalizations, the author, Terry Marselle, does the opposite. By the time this 738 page volume reaches chapters 5 & 6, he already has taken many deep dives into exactly what is wrong with both Common Core math and ELA (English Arts) at all grade levels, i.e., pre-K through the 12th grade. Equally important, however, is that the first half of the book has lived up to its title. Marselle meticulously documents how the Common Core's authors and supporters have a fundamental non-understanding of how students of various ages think and learn. Of particular interest is the scholarly manner in which the author lays out the alarming developmental inappropriateness of the Common Core in grades K-3. As an example, under the Common Core, play-based Kindergarten has disappeared and formal instruction, which used to start in Grade One, has taken its place. This is despite the fact that well-grounded research tells us that providing a play-based education in the earliest years is a soft option.In Chapter 2, Marselle educates the reader in great detail about how the diversity of America\u2019s schoolchildren is so vast, no other country\u2019s students in the history of humankind come close. For example, nearly 14% of America\u2019s current residents were born outside the United States. Add to this mix, wide variations in socio-economics among this country\u2019s school children and it becomes clear, the root cause of the Achievement Gap is almost certainly the result of a lack of equity in education. Translation: poverty and all its by-products. These are things that neither a \u201ccommon core\u201d of academic standards (even if they were attainable), nor the blaming of teachers will fix.Two of the most fascinating chapters are 3 and 4. In Chapter 3, the author documents his assertion that the Common Core from the ground up, is an upward spiraling staircase of abstract, intuitive, divergent thinking \u2013 a mode of cognition that only 27 to 30% of the general population can do with relative ease.In Chapter 4, the author demonstrates his research skills when he exposes the greatly flawed pedagogy of the Common Core. For example, as any classroom teacher in America will tell you, one of the trendiest of trends in education is \u201ccollaborative learning.\u201d There is only one problem with this fad. All available research strongly suggests that collaborative learning only works if everyone at the table is an expert to begin with. Otherwise, students end up exchanging ignorance and/or a disproportionate percentage of students end up doing the heavy lifting for the task at hand.As mentioned above, this book deserves covers seemingly every conceivable educational topic and its relationship to the Common Core. Students with Special Needs, ELLs (English Language Learners), Gifted & Talented students\u2026even students seeking the GED (General Equivalency Diploma) are all covered in a comprehensive manner.Two years in the making, Perfectly Incorrect was written by a real teacher with decades of experience and who continues to teach real students on a daily basis. Having been recently awarded (2014) a Master\u2019s Degree in Psychology \u2013 with a concentration in children\u2019s cognition, Marselle brings much to the table - and we're glad he did.In the tumult of education reform, books such as this are uncommon. First, the author placed the discussion of the Common Core under one roof.",

Are the very words \"prose poem\" an oxymoron? This groundbreaking anthology edited by celebrated poet David Lehman, editor of The Best American Poetry series, traces the form in all its dazzling variety from Poe and Emerson to Auden and Ashbery and on, right up to the present. In his brilliant and lucid introduction, Lehman defines the prose poem, summarizes its French heritage, and outlines its history in the United States. Included here are important works from masters of American literature, as well as poems by contemporary mainstays and emerging talents who demonstrate why the form has become an irresistible option for the practicing poet today. Great American Prose Poems is a marvelous collection, a must-have for anyone interested in the current state of the art.",

It takes place at some unspecified future date when mankind has entered another dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the use of the word \"I\" is punishable by death). Rand, as a teenager living in Soviet Russia, initially conceived Anthem as a play. This is a novel upholding Rand's central principles of her philosophy and of her heroes: reason, values, volition, individualism. (Summary by Wikipedia and the Reader)",

A man who cut the beaks off of pelicans is found dead and lipless. Another man who ran a dog fighting ring is found torn apart by his own dogs.

His new venue, the quaint little village of Eastvale, seems to have more than its fair share of malefactors-among them a brazen Peeping Tom who hides in night's shadows spying on attractive, unsuspecting ladies as they prepare for bed. When an elderly woman is found brutally slain in her home, Chief Inspector Banks wonders if the voyeur has increased the awful intensity of his criminal activities. But whether related or not, perverse local acts and murderous ones are combining to profoundly touch Banks's suddenly vulnerable personal life, forcing a dedicated law officer to make hard choices he'd dearly hoped would never be necessary.",

        "description": "Calum and Neil are the cone-gatherers - two brothers at work in the forest of a large Scottish estate. But the harmony of their life together is shadowed by the dark obsessive hatred of Duror, the gamekeeper. Set during the Second World War, Robin Jenkins' greatest novel is an immensely powerful examination of good and evil, and mankind's propensity for both. Removed from the destruction and bloodshed of the war, the brothers' oblivious happiness becomes increasingly fragile as darker forces close in around them. With its themes of class-conflict, war, evil and envy, \"The Cone-Gatherers\" is a towering work of fiction that remains as relevant today as when it was first published. Suspenseful, dark and unforgettable, it is one of the masterpieces of modern Scottish literature.",

Placing the best-known historical episodes within the broader sweep of the past, the bestselling Land of the Midnight Sun is the standard source for understanding the Yukon's history. It has been completely revised and brought up to the present in this new edition.\" Emphasizing the role of First Nations people and the lengthy struggle of Yukoners to find their place within Confederation, Ken Coates and William Morrison also explore the impressive Elka-Keno Hill silver mines, the impact of residential schools on Aboriginal children, the devastation caused by the sinking of the Princess Sophia, the Yukon's remarkable contributions to the Canadian World War I effort, and the sweeping transformations associated with the American \"occupation\" during World War II.",

        "description": "Far, far north, sitting above the Arctic Circle, Lapland is a world made of ice; a place both foreign and perilous that unexpectedly lures New Yorker Clarissa Iverton from what had finally become a comfortable life. At 14, her mother disappeared. Now 28, and just days after the death of her father, Clarissa discovers that he wasn't her father after all, and the only clues to her true heritage are a world away. Abandoning her fianc\u00e9, she flies to Helsinki, seeking to uncover the secrets her mother kept for so long. While piecing together the fragments of her mother's mysterious past, Clarissa is led to the Sami, Lapland's native \"reindeer people,\" who dwell in a stark and frozen landscape, under the northern lights. It is there that she must summon the courage to confront an unbearable truth, and the violent act that ties her to this ancient people.Vida's second novel is the riveting story of an unthinkable quest. Her indomitable heroine, Clarissa Iverton, slowly and painfully (but not without a sense of humor) peels away years of old lies in order to embrace a history she could never have imagined. Sharply focused and beautifully told,Let the Northern Lights Erase Your Nameis an ambitious and accomplished work of fiction that resonates with the themes of truth and forgiveness.(Spring 2007 Selection)",

        "description": "In zijn onnavolgbare, pakkende, soms geestige stijl richt Richard Dawkins zijn scherpzinnige pijlen op het geloof in een bovennatuurlijke god. Dawkins bekritiseert het godsidee in al zijn vormen, van de door seks geobsedeerde tiran van het Oude Testament tot de heel wat minzamere (maar nog altijd onlogische) 'Grote Klokkenmaker' van sommige verlichtingsdenkers. Hij laat geen spaan heel van de belangrijkste argumenten voor religie (het bieden van troost, het funderen van ethiek, etc.) en toont de grote onwaarschijnlijkheid van een opperwezen aan. Hij laat zien hoe religie oorlog voedt, onverdraagzaamheid in de hand werkt en aanzet tot kindermishandeling. De auteur maakt overtuigend duidelijk dat geloof in God niet alleen irrationeel is, maar ook potentieel dodelijk.Dawkins heeft een even gepassioneerde als rigoureuze weerlegging van religieuze aanspraken geformuleerd, die omarmd zal worden door iedereen die zich stoort aan de inconsistenties en wreedheden waarvan de Bijbel, weliswaar van grote literair-historische waarde volgens Dawkins, doorspekt is; door iedereen die niets moet hebben van de oppervlakkigheid van Intelligent Design; door iedereen die zich kwaad maakt over het fundamentalisme in het Midden-Oosten of in de hedendaagse VS. Dawkins' boek zal een welkome steun in de rug zijn voor ieder die zich met trots athe\u00efst durft te noemen. En een vurig pleidooi voor het 'uit de kast komen' van ieder die zich diep in zijn hart al een athe\u00efst weet. Een ongelooflijk boek over het ultieme onderwerp, dat beslist veel stof zal doen opwaaien. Controversieel, actueel, urgent.",

        "description": "InWorld-Systems Analysis, Immanuel Wallerstein provides a concise and accessible introduction to the comprehensive approach that he pioneered thirty years ago to understanding the history and development of the modern world. Since Wallerstein first developed world-systems analysis, it has become a widely utilized methodology within the historical social sciences and a common point of reference in discussions of globalization. Now, for the first time in one volume, Wallerstein offers a succinct summary of world-systems analysis and a clear outline of the modern world-system, describing the structures of knowledge upon which it is based, its mechanisms, and its future.Wallerstein explains the defining characteristics of world-systems analysis: its emphasis on world-systems rather than nation-states, on the need to consider historical processes as they unfold over long periods of time, and on combining within a single analytical framework bodies of knowledge usually viewed as distinct from one another\u2014such as history, political science, economics, and sociology. He describes the world-system as a social reality comprised of interconnected nations, firms, households, classes, and identity groups of all kinds. He identifies and highlights the significance of the key moments in the evolution of the modern world-system: the development of a capitalist world-economy in the sixteenth-century, the beginning of two centuries of liberal centrism in the French Revolution of 1789, and the undermining of that centrism in the global revolts of 1968. Intended for general readers, students, and experienced practitioners alike, this book presents a complete overview of world-systems analysis by its original architect.",

When an avalanche of books cuts off access to his living room, university librarian Jasper Richardson can no longer ignore the truth. His ever-growing piles of books, magazines and newspapers can no longer be classified as a \"collection\". It's a hoard, and he needs professional help. Professional clutter clearer and counselor Lewis Miller thinks he's seen it all, but even he has to admit he's shocked. Not so much by the state of Jasper's house, but by the level of attraction he still feels for the sexy bookworm he remembers from school. What a shame that Lewis's ethical code forbids relationships with clients. As Jasper makes slow but steady progress, though, the magnetic pull between them is so strong even Lewis is having trouble convincing himself it's a temporary emotional attachment arising from the therapeutic process. Jasper longs to prove to Lewis that this is the real deal. But first he'll have to lay bare the root of his hoarding problem...and reveal the dark secret hidden behind his walls of books. Contains a level-headed counselor with a secret addiction, a bespectacled geek with a sweet tooth, a killer \"to-be-read\" pile, embarrassing parents, a van called Alice, and deliciously British slang.",

        "description": "Buck Owens was the top-selling country act of the 1960s, with 21 number-one hits and 35 consecutive top-ten hits, a total surpassed only by the Beatles. Inventor of the Bakersfield sound, he was hugely popular not only with country fans, but rock fans too. The Beatles covered his songs, Gram Parsons idolized him, the Grateful Dead loved him. At least five marriages, several TV shows, and a publishing and media empire followed. And a number of current country stars, ranging from Dwight Yoakam to Marty Stuart, owe their sound to him. Yet never before has there been a book about Buck Owens. And the man that emerges from its pages is the polar opposite of the aw-shucks image he cultivated on Hee-Haw . A tight-fisted control freak with an outsized appetite for sex, Owens could be ruthlessly cruel at one moment and as slippery as a snake the next. Buck Owens chronicles his rise from poverty as son of a sharecropper to one of the nation\u2019s best-loved entertainers, worth at least $100 million when he died. It is it counts among its myriad sources five Buckaroos, the producer of Hee Haw , the former president of Capitol Nashville, numerous country singers, relatives, wives, lovers, and employees. This biography fully reveals, for the first time, not only one of country\u2019s biggest stars, but perhaps its biggest son of a bitch.",

        "description": "One recent December, at age 53, John Kralik found his life at a terrible, frightening low: his small law firm was failing; he was struggling through a painful second divorce; he had grown distant from his two older children and was afraid he might lose contact with his young daughter; he was living in a tiny apartment where he froze in the winter and baked in the summer; he was 40 pounds overweight; his girlfriend had just broken up with him; and overall, his dearest life dreams--including hopes of upholding idealistic legal principles and of becoming a judge--seemed to have slipped beyond his reach.Then, during a desperate walk in the hills on New Year's Day, John was struck by the belief that his life might become at least tolerable if, instead of focusing on what he didn't have, he could find some way to be grateful for what he had.Inspired by a beautiful, simple note his ex-girlfriend had sent to thank him for his Christmas gift, John imagined that he might find a way to feel grateful by writing thank-you notes. To keep himself going, he set himself a goal--come what may--of writing 365 thank-you notes in the coming year.One by one, day after day, he began to handwrite thank yous--for gifts or kindnesses he'd received from loved ones and coworkers, from past business associates and current foes, from college friends and doctors and store clerks and handymen and neighbors, and anyone, really, absolutely anyone, who'd done him a good turn, however large or small. Immediately after he'd sent his very first notes, significant and surprising benefits began to come John's way--from financial gain to true friendship, from weight loss to inner peace. While John wrote his notes, the economy collapsed, the bank across the street from his office failed, but thank-you note by thank-you note, John's whole life turned around.A Simple Act of Gratitudeis a rare memoir: its touching, immediately accessible message--and benefits--come to readers from the plainspoken storytelling of an ordinary man. Kralik sets a believable, doable example of how to live a miraculously good life. To readA Simple Act of Gratitudeis to be changed.",

        "description": "Dog No. 241 lives in a crate in a cold, dark barn that is stacked with hundreds of other caged dogs in a puppy mill breeding operation. She has never known human companionship, exercise, or decent care. One night, rescuers arrive and take her and the other dogs away to lead new and happier lives. Soon, despite her fears, she finds herself in a warm, secure foster home, being bathed and groomed and loved by a young woman named Emma. At first, she is too frightened to respond; all she wants is to return to the familiar dark. Eventually renamed Dakota, she learns to love and trust Emma, and her foster home becomes a friendly haven. But then a new challenge arrives in the person of a young girl, Sweetie, who is recovering from a misfortune as deep as Dakota\u2019s own. Sweetie and her parents come to look at Dakota as a possible pet. Initially, Sweetie rejects hairless little Dakota, but later she returns to offer Dakota a home, and Emma recommends her for adoption. With Emma\u2019s reassurances, Dakota goes to her forever home to become Sweetie\u2019s true partner in recovery. Jan Zita Grover , author of North AIDS and Other Clear-Cuts (1997) and Northern Waters (1999), both from Graywolf Press, has worked in canine rescue since 1973, specifically with discarded puppy mill breed dogs. Dakota is modeled on one of Jan\u2019s own rescued dogs, Pixie.",

The fact that nearly half of the American population apparently believes this, purely on the basis of religious dogma, should be considered a moral and intellectual emergency.\"In response to his award-winning bestsellerThe End of Faith, Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God.Letter to A Christian Nationis his courageous and controversial reply. Using rational argument, Harris offers a measured refutation of the beliefs that form the core of fundamentalist Christianity.

        "description": "For millennia, mysticism has spread a special radiance over humanity. Today interest in mystical practices is increasing, and just as Sophy Burnham first focused modern awareness on the presence of angels in our lives, she now explores the drama and mystery of mystical experiences, and their power to change our lives.In this rich and deeply personal book, Burnham describes her own arduous and momentous journey into mystical awareness--the rowing toward God, as she calls it. That journey began with a subtle, unnamed longing, passed through various stages of prayer and spiritual awareness, and broke open in a single transformative moment at the ancient Peruvian site of Machu Picchu. Threaded through her own story, Burnham gives us scores of first-hand accounts of mystical encounters as recorded by ordinary people today, as well as by saints, seers, ecstatics, and holy men and women of every faith.In addition, Burnham delves into the physical side of mystical experience--levitation, elevated body temperature, psychic ability--and warns against an overemphasis on such powers. She also describes the age-old practices that invite mystical experience--prayer and fasting, meditation, ascetic discipline--and points out the landmarks that one passes on this extraordinary spiritual journey.Passionate, beautifully written, and comprehensive, The Ecstatic Journey is a feast of fact and myth, knowledge and wisdom, that will nourish and enlighten every spiritual voyager.",

        "description": "The book tells the story of a young woman suffering with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), a psychiatric illness characterized primarily by mood swings, unstable relationships, depression and self-destructive behavior. Pamela Tusiani's copious journals, moving artwork and poetry provide an intimate glimpse of her battle with a personality she could not control. Intertwined with Pamela's voice, Bea Tusiani tells the story of her daughter's struggle and the roller-coaster effect it had on her family. The two points of view present a unique insight into Pamela's state of mind. Based on Bea's and her husband's notes, taken during conversations with Pamela, her doctors and other healthcare providers, this book allows the reader to live through Pamela's day-to-day ordeal and experience the anxiety, love and fear of her family members. This is not just the story of one vibrant, gifted young woman and her courageous family. It is a real life account of an illness that irreparably changes one's world. It raises questions for family and friends of those plagued by BPD. To whom do you turn? How can you help? What do you do when you can't help? Whom do you trust? Where are the boundaries? How do you keep going? Hopefully, this book will provide some answers. Pamela wrote in her diary, \"There I stood, in a hole, deep in the ground. Did I dig it or just get in? Did I fall into it? Did someone else dig it and throw me in?\" The hole is still there, but through the telling of her valiant endeavor, Pamela extends a hand to help others climb out. Remnants penetrates the heart. To read it, is truly inspirational.",

        "description": "A world-class business education in a single volume.Getting an MBA is an expensive choice-one almost impossible to justify regardless of the state of the economy. Even the elite schools like Harvard and Wharton offer outdated, assembly-line programs that teach you more about PowerPoint presentations and unnecessary financial models than what it takes to run a real business. You can get better results (and save hundreds of thousands of dollars) by skipping B-school altogether.Josh Kaufman founded PersonalMBA.com as an alternative to the business school boondoggle. His blog has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the best business books and most powerful business concepts of all time. Now, he shares the essentials of entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, negotiation, operations, productivity, systems design, and much more, in one comprehensive volume.The Personal MBAdistills the most valuable business lessons into simple, memorable mental models that can be applied to real-world challenges.The Personal MBAexplains concepts such as:*The Iron Law of the Market:Why every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it attempts to serve-and how to find large, hungry markets.*The 12 Forms of Value:Products and services are only two of the twelve ways you can create value for your customers.*The Pricing Uncertainty Principle:All prices are malleable. Raising your prices is the best way to dramatically increase profitability-if you know how to support the price you're asking.*4 Methods to Increase Revenue:There are only four ways a business can bring in more money. Do you know what they are?True leaders aren't made by business schools-they make themselves, seeking out the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to succeed. Read this book and you will learn the principles it takes most business professionals a lifetime of trial and error to master.",

        "description": "Poetry. Finalist, Acorn-Plantos Award. Winner, Exit Through the Giftshop Award (2013). Best Poetry of 2012 selection, Winnipeg Free Press . Each new volume by Stuart Ross is a more confounding grab bag than the last. In YOU EXIST. DETAILS FOLLOW., his seventh full- length collection of poetry, Stuart Ross veers in opposite narrative confessionalism poems, and works that might be considered abstract expressionist, and a lot both in between and beyond those boundaries. Still, each poem breathes with the signature weirdness, the sharp wit and gentle awe that Ross is known for. Here you'll find poems from Ross's ongoing auto-biographical Razovsky series, one-line poems, centos, fractured sonnets, poems composed through surrealist strategies, and more.\"Ross's absurdism doesn't rely on unconnected sentences, abstract thought, or an unusual, elevated rather, his poetry delights in the silliness of concrete mundanity.\u2026The collection thus begins by launching us into a happily disjointed mind, into images connected as though by sparking, duct-taped wires, buzzing weird electrical fires of thought.\"\u2014 Matrix Magazine\"A voice all his own. Stuart Ross unleashes his refreshing snark in his latest collection of poems\u2026He runs the gamut from his own brand of absurdist expressionism to fond childhood memories and poetic confessions.\u2026Ross wisely and parenthetically (Tension is a good thing sometimes. For example, you should stick it in art.) Stuart Ross loves that tension, fortunately for his readers.\"\u2014 Uptown\"I personally believe Stuart Ross may be Canada's most important poet\u2026Ross could be called a 'narrative surrealist' but that, like most labels, does not adequately capture the gymnastic feats of construction he employs. At his best Ross combines images and emotions with the same alacrity of a Max Ernst or Salvador Dali. The literal is a sheer curtain that surrealists drape like a fabric or a fold in time. Ross gives a master class in almost every poem in the delicate art of balancing truth from fiction, what we imagine from what we know to be real\u2026For me, there is no poet as entertaining as Stuart Ross and very few as smart. Ross builds a new universe with You Exist. Details Follow. and we get to travel in it like explorers entering a new dimension, luckily it comes with instructions and a guide map for home. \"Stuart Ross looks at the world through a different lens, how extraordinarily lucky we are that he shares that view with us.\" \u2014Michael Dennis (blog)",

These six treatises offer his informed insights into the nature of leadership.In the dialogue between the poet Simonides and Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, Xenophon provides a consummate consideration of the burdens of being an absolute dictator and the superior happiness of the private man. Elsewhere, his biography of King Agesilaus II of Sparta depicts the author's patron as a model of piety, justice, courage and wisdom, while other texts consider the essential qualities of the cavalry commander, analyze the skills of the horseman and the hunter, and advance a bold economic plan for democratic Athens.",

Now, author Glenn Singleton shares the challenges that have often led to random acts of equity and pockets of excellence rather than systemic transformation.In a book that\u2032s rich with anecdote, Singleton celebrates the successes, outlines the difficulties, and provides specific strategies for moving Courageous Conversations from racial equity theory to practice at every level, from classroom to the school superintendent\u2032s office. Voices From the Inside narratives, written by champions of racial equity, offer moving illustrations of personal, professional, and organizational transformations.Here\u2032s the MORE in More Courageous Conversations About Race :Examines the knowing-doing gap and suggests ways to transform your passion for racial equity into a powerful purpose that can transform our nation\u2032s schools and classrooms.Demonstrates the positive outcomes for students and their schools when educators have the will, the skill, and the knowledge to sustain courageous conversations about race.Shows how the social and political climate provides increasing challenges to ensuring that underserved students get the educational opportunities they need to succeed.Explicitly embraces other people of color in the drive for racial equity and illustrates how the Courageous Conversations Protocol can be applied to their circumstances.Offers specific advice for engaging leaders beyond the school house door--district staff, superintendents, school boards, and local community leaders--and underscores the importance of their contributions.If you are committed to exercising leadership on behalf of all students, and especially underserved students of color, More Courageous Conversations About Race provides insight and inspiration for achieving your racial equity purpose.",

        "description": "Pugs love people and they love to socialize; and the people who love them rarely leave them behind. Uninterested in herding, hunting, or howling, these small, odd-looking creatures have no higher purpose in life than to be entertaining and companionable. Pugs in Public is a unique tribute to a breed of dog that inspires near slavish devotion in its owners and perpetual amusement in all observers. Meet Tuck, who roams his owner's prestigious art gallery all day-except during his three o'clock break for biscuits at the Four Seasons Hotel. Mickey reviews portfolios at one of New York City's hottest modeling agencies; Buddy is the quality control specialist at a bicycle shop; and Pee Wee is the de facto maitre d' at a chic caf. Pug owners are a rare breed of their own, and this book also turns the spotlight on New Yorker cartoonist Victoria Roberts poses with Pogo, her best friend and artist's model. Even the Bishop of New York, the Right Reverend Richard F. Grein, appears in full ecclesiastical dress with his adored pug Bruno. Pugs in Public, a special look at a special pet, makes a great gift for any animal lover.",

Tracking his own strange and unexpected voyage from journeyman cook to globe-traveling professional eater and drinker, and even to fatherhood, Bourdain takes no prisoners as he dissects what he's seen, pausing along the way for a series of confessions, rants, investigations, and interrogations of some of the most controversial figures in food.",

        "description": "On the surface, LUNCH WITH BUDDHA is a story about family. Otto Ringling and his sister Cecelia could not be more different. He\u2019s just turned 50, an editor of food books at a prestigious New York publishing house, a man with a nice home in the suburbs, children he adores, and a sense of himself as being a mainstream, upper-middle-class American. Cecelia is the last thing from mainstream. For two decades she\u2019s made a living reading palms and performing past-life regressions. She believes firmly in our ability to communicate with those who have passed on.It will turn out, though, that they have more in common than just their North Dakota roots.In LUNCH WITH BUDDHA, when Otto faces what might be the greatest of life\u2019s difficulties, it is Cecelia who knows how to help him. As she did years earlier in this book\u2019s predecessor, BREAKFAST WITH BUDDHA, she arranges for her brother to travel with Volya Rinpoche, a famous spiritual teacher \u2014 who now also happens to be her husband.After early chapters in which the family gathers for an important event, the novel portrays a road trip made by Otto and Rinpoche, in a rattling pickup, from Seattle to the family farm in North Dakota. Along the way the brothers-in-law have a series of experiences \u2014 some hilarious, some poignant \u2014 all aimed at bringing Otto a deeper peace of mind. They visit American landmarks; they have a variety of meals, both excellent and awful; they meet a cast of minor characters, each of whom enables Rinpoche to impart some new spiritual lesson. Their conversations range from questions about life and death to talk of history, marijuana, child-rearing, sexuality, Native Americans, and outdoor swimming.In the end, with the help of their miraculous daughter, Shelsa, and the prodding of Otto\u2019s own almost-adult children, Rinpoche and Cecelia push this decent, middle-of-the-road American into a more profound understanding of the purpose of his life. His sense of the line between possible and impossible is altered, and the story\u2019s ending points him toward a very different way of being in this world.",

        "description": "Is there any arena in the contemporary church more perplexing than small groups? Leaders and participants alike fill them with promises of unparalleled spiritual intimacy and reliable relationship. Experts put forward model after model, paradigm after paradigm, and frustrated small group leaders and followers meander from one to the next in increasingly vain hope that the next model will deliver the goods. What could be more natural than a group of people sitting together, talking? What could be more contrived than a packaged curriculum, with prefab questions and notes for leaders? Such is the problem of small groups. Scott Boren has wrestled with these challenges for years, in the context of his own small-group ministries and in consultation with churches of every stripe. In this book he reminds us that any small group, no matter how it's organized, is at its heart a collection of people each walking in the way of Jesus. That means we are going somewhere\u2015together\u2015and that means we have a reliable guide.",

But history professor David Mapstone, just hired by the Sheriffs Office, still finds trouble, chasing a robber into an abandoned warehouse and discovering a gruesome crime from six decades ago.Mapstone begins an investigation into a Depression-era kidnapping that transfixed Arizona and the the disappearance of a cattle barons grandsons, their bodies never found. And although the kidnapper was caught and executed, Mapstone uncovers evidence that justice was far from done. But this is no history lesson. The cattle barons heirs now run a Fortune 500 company and wield far more clout than a former-professor-turned-deputy. Then one of the heirs turns up dead....",

        "description": "Spoiler alert: Talking about Jesus is awkward. We love to share good news with the world. We tweet about a great new restaurant, we share pictures of our newborn child and we celebrate about receiving that sought-after promotion. We are evangelists for many great things. So why don't we do the same with Jesus? It's not hard to see that we bring our own anxieties and awkwardness into every evangelistic conversation. Not to mention the often vast differences between our experiences of God and religion and those of the people around us. And then there's the inner awkwardness of our conversation partners, who are actively contending, even unconsciously, with the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives. Evangelism is awkward, yes. But on the other side of that awkwardness is something amazing: transformed lives, healed relationships, new vision, eternal life. After spending years working with college students and churchgoers, Beau Crosetto hasn't solved the problem of awkwardness in evangelism. But he's learned how to push through it and how we can set ourselves and those we love at ease as we enter into conversations of eternal consequence. Read this book and move beyond awkward into the most awesome privilege of God's people: proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ.",

        "description": "The problem of faith and reason is as old as Christianity itself. Today's philosophical, scientific and historical challenges make the epistemic problem inescapable for believers. Can faith justify its claims? Does faith give us confidence in the truth ? Is believing with certainty a virtue or a vice? In Theology?s Epistemological Dilemma , Kevin Diller addresses this problem by drawing on two of the most significant responses in recent Christian Karl Barth's theology of revelation and Alvin Plantinga's epistemology of Christian belief. This will strike many as unlikely, given the common stereotypes of both thinkers. Contrary to widespread misunderstanding, Diller offers a reading of both as complementary to each Barth provides what Plantinga lacks in theological depth, while Plantinga provides what Barth lacks in philosophical clarity. Diller presents a unified Barth/Plantinga proposal for theological epistemology capable of responding without anxiety to the questions that face believers today.",

        "description": "Preaching 's Best Books for Preachers Best Theological Memoir from Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Bookstore How did one of the twentieth century's most celebrated liberals have such a dramatic change of heart? After growing up in the heart of rural Methodism in Oklahoma, Thomas Oden found Marx, Nietzsche and Freud storming into his imagination. He joined the post-World War II pacifist movement and became enamored with every aspect of the 1950s' ecumenical Student Christian Movement. Ten years before America's entry into the Vietnam war he admired Ho Chi Min as an agrarian patriot. For Oden, every turn was a left turn. At Yale he earned his PhD under H. Richard Niebuhr and later met with some of the most formidable minds of the era\u2015enjoying conversations with Gadamer, Bultmann and Pannenberg as well as a lengthy discussion with Karl Barth at a makeshift office in his hospital room. While traveling with his family through Turkey, Syria and Israel, he attended Vatican II as an observer and got his first taste of ancient Christianity. And slowly, he stopped making left turns. Oden's enthusiasms for pacifism, ecumenism and the interface between theology and psychotherapy were ambushed by varied shapes of reality. Yet it was a challenge from a Jewish scholar, his friend and mentor Will Herberg, that precipitated his most dramatic turn\u2015back to the great minds of ancient Christianity. Later a meeting with then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Benedict XVI) planted the seeds for what became Oden's highly influential Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. This fascinating memoir walks us through not only his personal history but some of the most memorable chapters in twentieth-century theology.",

The intersection of these two worlds makes him a fruitful dialogue partner for thinking creatively about what it means to be faithful to Jesus Christ today. In this collection of essays both old and new, Kimlyn Bender explores Barth's understanding of Christ, church and world in conversation with American evangelicalism, Roman Catholicism, Reinhard H\u00fctter, Adolf von Harnack, Bart Ehrman and Baptists, among others. Along the way he also engages the theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher. Bender's penetrating analysis of modern theology sheds light on both the task of theology and the witness of the church.",

The story is told through the experiences a Native American Nipmuc man who fights to change the future, while coming to terms with his own troubled past and the acceptance of his family. For Neempau, the ultimate remedy is to challenge and end one of America\u2019s favorite holidays: Thanksgiving.His heart-wrenching, daring, and sometimes humorous journey not only exposes the innermost core of Native American struggles, but also the complexities of the notion of race, tradition, and identity. This brilliant story transcends cultural differences and inspires new thinking while taking readers beyond the boundaries of the past.It\u2019s these very complicated issues that contemporary Native families struggle with for a holiday that most take for granted as a time for feasting and football. While this is a novel that highlights the contradiction of the history and tradition of two cultures, in no way does it exclude either from the well-told tale that Larry spins about one family\u2019s journey to come to terms with Thanksgiving. Neither preachy nor dry,The Mourning Road to Thanksgivingis an engaging read\u2014sometimes deadly serious, sometimes poignant, sometimes humorous, always relevant.",

        "description": "\"Jean-Jacques Sempe's witty drawings and keen eye for the finer points of the human condition have delighted readers in France and beyond for over forty years. Now, his sharply observed and beautifully drawn cartoons are available in English for the first time.\" In 'Everything is Complicated', first published in 1963, a number of Sempe's favourite subjects are already clearly in evidence, such as mild-mannered men and women with colourful inner lives and people who choose to express themselves through the medium of the protest sign. There are also cartoons about hapless tourists, pipe-smoking novelists and unruly schoolchildren. Sempe is equally adept at capturing the little indignities (and triumphs) of everyday life as he is at high farce and physical comedy. The captions were translated by Anthea Bell, who also helped to bring Asterix the Gaul to the English-speaking world.",

The barricaded cities, erected by the government to protect the remnants of civilization, have become a brutal dictatorship- causing the inhabitants within to starve, steal and claw for survival. Life behind the walls has become as terrifying as roaming the zombie-ridden landscape beyond. Citizens trade what they can to gain food, water, and shelter. Nina has only one currency-her body and she is tired of submitting herself to the greedy hands of the self-proclaimed leaders. An opportunity to escape presents itself in the fate of a young girl named Emily-Rose. For the price of a stale piece of bread, she is set for banishment from the city, and most likely a horrific death at the hands of the deaders. Nina tells herself that it is sympathy and not self-preservation that makes her follow the young girl out of the walled metropolis, and into the overgrown world beyond. Unused to fighting the deaders, Nina tries to scrounge for her survival and against her better judgment, begins to care for Emily-Rose. However, when you have a bread-stealing liability providing your only back up, survival seems even tougher. Nina is forced to fight for their lives, and with every zombie slain, she becomes fiercer, faster - a grim reaper with her not-so-sharp butcher's knife. Along the path to a safe-haven that might not exist, Nina and Emily-Rose meet Mikey who introduces them to a new life they could not imagine, a life above the ground. However, this new world brings new dangers, and darker shadows than she knew. Nina finds out that the deaders aren't the only thing to fear beyond the wall. And that fear will not be ignored, or Forgotten.",

The women of the family brought about its advancement, beginning with the heiresses Alice Bracton Boleyn, Anne Hoo Boleyn and Margaret Butler Boleyn who brought wealth and aristocratic connections. Then there was Elizabeth Howard Boleyn, who was rumored to have been the mistress of Henry VIII, along with her daughter Mary and niece Madge, who certainly were. Anne Boleyn became the king's second wife and her aunts, Lady Boleyn and Lady Shelton, helped bring her to the block. The infamous Jane Boleyn, the last of her generation, betrayed her husband before dying on the scaffold with Queen Catherine Howard.The next generation was no less turbulent and Catherine Carey, the daughter of Mary Boleyn fled from England to avoid persecution under Mary Tudor. Her daughter, Lettice was locked in bitter rivalry with the greatest Boleyn lady of all, Elizabeth I, winning the battle for the affections of Robert Dudley but losing her position in society as a consequence. Finally, another Catherine Carey, the Countess of Nottingham, was so close to her cousin, the queen, that Elizabeth died of grief following her death.The Boleyn family was the most ambitious dynasty of the sixteenth century, rising dramatically to prominence in the early years of a century that would end with a Boleyn on the throne.",

        "description": "From the opening line--\"Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last\"--you will know that you are in the hands of a masterful storyteller and in the company of a fascinating woman hero. Inspired by a brief passage in Melville'sMoby-Dick, where Captain Ahab speaks passionately of his young wife on Nantucket, Una Spenser's moving tale\"is very much Naslund's own and can be enjoyed independently of its source.\"(Newsday)The daughter of a tyrannical father, Una leaves the violent Kentucky frontier for the peace of a New England lighthouse island, where she simultaneously falls in love with two young men. Disguised as a boy, she earns a berth on a whaling ship where she encounters the power of nature, death, and madness, and gets her first glimpse of Captain Ahab. As Naslund portrays Una's love for the tragically driven Ahab, she magnificently renders a real, living marriage and offers a new perspective on the American experience. Immediately immersed in this world, the reader experiences a brilliantly written, vibrant, uplifting novel--a bright book of life.",

        "description": "How can the baffling problems of phenomenal experience be accounted for? In this provocative book, Fred Dretske argues that to achieve an understanding of the mind it is not enough to understand the biological machinery by means of which the mind does its job. One must understand what the mind's job is and how this task can be performed by a physical system \u2014 the nervous system.Naturalizing the Mindskillfully develops a representational theory of the qualitative, the phenomenal, the what-it-is-like aspects of the mind that have defied traditional forms of naturalism. Central to Dretske's approach is the claim that the phenomenal aspects of perceptual experiences are one and the same as external, real-world properties that experience represents objects as having. Combined with an evolutionary account of sensory representation, the result is a completely naturalistic account of phenomenal consciousness.",

        "description": "The latest of Ian Hughes' Late Roman biographies here tackles the careers of the brother emperors, Valentinian and Valens. Valentian was selected and proclaimed as emperor in AD 364, when the Empire was still reeling from the disastrous defeat and death in battle of Julian the Apostate (363) and the short reign of his murdered successor, Jovian (364). With the Empire weakened and vulnerable to a victorious Persia in the East and opportunistic Germanic tribes along the Rhine and Danube frontiers, not to mention usurpers and rebellions within, it was not an enviable position. Valentian decided the responsibility had to be divided (not for the first or last time) and appointed his brother as his co-emperor to rule the eastern half of the Empire.Valentinian went on to stabilize the Western Empire, quelling revolt in North Africa, defeating the 'Barbarian Conspiracy' that attacked Britain in 367 and conducting successful wars against the Germanic Alemanni, Quadi and Saxons; he is remembered by History as a strong and successful Emperor. Valens on the other hand, fare less well and is most remembered for his (mis)treatment of the Goths who sought refuge within the Empire's borders from the westward-moving Huns. Valens mishandling of this situation led to the Battle of Adrianople in 378, where he was killed and Rome suffered one of the worst defeats in her long history, often seen as the 'beginning of the end' for the Western Roman empire. Ian Hughes, by tracing the careers of both men in tandem, compares their achievements and analyzes the extent to which they deserve the contrasting reputations handed down by history.",

Facing death threats from America's political enemies and nearly dying from illness on the other, Murphy faced a difficult professional situation with the notion he was a fugitive \"from the law of averages.\"Now you can read about Oscar-winning talent making a film in Saigon in 1957. Surviving members of cast and crew reveal their insights in exclusive interviews.

Nor moved through the East Village and Jerusalem, Syria and Lebanon, with a guide who spies \u2018what grows in broken concrete.' This is exploration and revelation via the road less traveled. Where she finally lands pales beside how she sees the world through her tongue. The journey is all.\u201dSolecism is the nonstandard or ungrammatical usage, a breach in etiquette, or any error, impropriety or inconsistency; these poems, according to Alexander Long, \u201cconfront the darker side of multi-culturalism, the vertiginous disorientation of being neither this nor that, neither here nor there, essentially being exiled in her own homelands. \u201c Gritty yet lyrical, Kamilah Aisha Moon says \u201cthese brazen, keen explorations are lit by intriguing desires that mirror and unearth our own, fueled by a deft imagination and wielding of language that rings deeply true. The world needs these tough angel anthems.\u201dDrawing upon the author\u2019s Jewish, Middle Eastern and Mexican heritage, Stephan Delbos remarks: \u201cHer poetry is aware of the world's urgencies, and, troubled, engages them in a barbed dream-language of vengeful longing, a language as fragmented as our world, achieving a startled and startling wholeness from the vivid pieces.\u201d Andre Yang observes: \u201cThere is a great fierceness in these poems that is balanced with just the right amount of tenderness\u201d In this stunning debut, as Marian Haddad claims, \u201cBen-Oni is the dark bird\u2014 that sparrow, singing.\u201d",

De Amsterdamse vioolbouwer Walter Vedder leest in de krant dat er op de plaats van zijn huis een groot hotel gebouwd gaat worden, en onmiddellijk begrijpt hij de kracht van zijn onderhandelingspositie tegenover de Nv Victorie Hotel, die hem immers zal moeten uitkopen.In dezelfde tijd, maar dan in Hoogeveen, krijgt zijn neef, de oude apotheker Anijs, een nieuwe concurrent. Wanneer hij ontdekt dat die jongeman, anders dan hijzelf, een universitaire graad in de farmacie bezit, besluit hij zijn ambitie te verschuiven van het medische, waarin hij toch al overvleugeld is, naar het medemenselijke: het gebrek in een naburig turfstekengehucht is groot; de mensen zouden eigenlijk moeten worden verplaatst, maar dat kost een vermogen - precies het vermogen dat Walter Vedder wel voor zijn huis meent te kunnen bedingen. Vanaf dat moment slaan beide verhaallijnen ineen tot \u00e9\u00e9n grote intrige, en houden de twee hoofdpersonen elkaar onbedoeld vast in een wederzijdse wurggreep, die ook de lezer zal benauwen, tot de bevrijdende finale aan toe: Amerika.Publieke werkenis een uiterst strak gecomponeerde historische roman. Het heen en weer van de alternerende vertelwijze geeft de verraderlijke overgang te zien van inzicht naar verblinding, van erbarmen naar ijdelheid: de tragiek van de strevende mens. Intussen is dan ook een raadsel of de anomalie verklaard van de twee oude huisjes, die nog steeds te zien zijn in de gevel van het Amsterdamse Victoria Hotel.",

        "description": "Facing the elevator door in his company\u2019s parking lot, Mitchell Geathers feels compelled to pinch himself for being elevated from the fear of gunfire in his childhood neighborhood. Now that he\u2019s in control of his life, he won\u2019t let anything take him back to the helpless existence of his youth. He approaches his love interest with the same zeal he does his career but isn't as successful. Her heart belongs to Drew Royce, a bad boy from the same streets he wants to forget. When Drew is executed for patricide, Mitchell sees an opportunity to connect with her, fueling unexpected retaliation from a much more powerful \u2013 and undead \u2013 Drew. After receiving an eerie message, Mitchell is made to bear witness to a disturbing attack on his youngest sister by a ferocious \u201cwind beast.\u201d When Mitchell learns the source of her infection is a group of invincible, shape shifting Windstalkers, no measure of protection, logic or reason is enough to keep her from slipping further into an inhuman fate. Blind and vulnerable to their attacks, Mitchell must put his own life on the line to track the creatures and discover a weakness - or lose his sister forever.Fueled by a familiar fear, Mitchell is running out of time in an unending nightmare - one in which he ultimately becomes the hunted.",

        "description": "An absorbing novel of crime, its terrifying consequences, and a bond that redefines the friendship of three restless young men. Wall Street speculators, the Manhattan downtown club scene, Russian gangsters, immigrant neighborhoods - all the elements in the urban turf of this finely crafted contemporary crime novel wed danger with excitement and possibility. They're the rewards that Monty Brogan, who stands at the center of the moral glare in this tale, has already lost, just as he's lost his Corvette, and the \"sway\" that opened the doors of exclusive night spots and guaranteed him courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow Monty's traveling by bus, to the federal prison in Otisville, for seven years. He's afraid, and all he'd ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. With the pulse of the city in its prose, this debut novel follows Monty through the twenty-four hours of his last day out. At the same time, it illuminates the worlds, and souls, of his two best friends: Frank Slattery, an edgy bond trader who gambles daily with financial ruin, and Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who clings to illusions as he compromises his ideals. Friends since their high school days, the three of them nostalgically share a past, but warily they confront a future that can no longer accommodate their adolescent dreams. They meet. They drink, and talk, go clubbing, dance, drink, and remember. What neither Slattery nor Jakob know, however, is that Monty has a plan. It's a shocker.",

        "description": "Every plant has its own distinct spiritual energy or its own deva. Devas are the radiant light of the Universal Divine which permeates all things. Since the earliest times people were aware that all of Nature is divine. Great and wondrous myths were told which explained the presence of divine energy as it exists in thunder, in trees and in sunlight. Some of this lore was the foundation of religions. But the simpler stories such as those of a plant's energy explored day-to-day matters like health and love. This understanding of the world has been preserved in folklore through poems, chants, ditties and spells. From researching the history of folklore from cultures around the world, patterns emerge which enable us to approach the true nature of plants' devas. This compendium presents the lore and the corresponding usage for 330 magickal herbs. Great care was taken only to include folklore that was documented as being authentic.You will meet many new herbs in this text and explore fascinating magickal and religious uses. But most of all we hope you come to respect the divine that surrounds your everyday life.",

Now the Blessed Lands are ruled by pure faith, while in the Republic, reason is the guiding light-two different realms, kept apart and at peace by a treaty and an ocean.Children of the Republic, Helena and Jason were inseparable in their youth, until fate sent them down different paths. Grief and duty sidetracked Helena's plans, and Jason came to detest the hollowness of his ambitions.These two damaged souls are reunited when a tiny boat from the Blessed Lands crashes onto the rocks near Helena's home after an impossible journey across the forbidden ocean. On board is a single passenger, a nine-year-old girl named Kailani, who calls herself \"The Daughter of the Sea and the Sky.\" A new and perilous purpose binds Jason and Helena together again, as they vow to protect the lost innocent from the wrath of the authorities, no matter the risk to their future and freedom.But is the mysterious child simply a troubled little girl longing to return home? Or is she a powerful prophet sent to unravel the fabric of a godless Republic, as the outlaw leader of an illegal religious sect would have them believe? Whatever the answer, it will change them all forever... and perhaps their world as well.",

        "description": "If Abraham Lincoln was the great moral force of his age, Phineas Taylor Barnum was its great provider of joy. As one of the earliest practitioners of \"the show business,\" Barnum dedicated his long career to alleviating the \u201csevere and drudging practicalness\u201d he considered the chief defect of American civilization. His remedy? A prodigious swarm of divas, minstrels, circuses, museums of curiosities, beauty pageants, sideshows, fat-baby and poultry contests \u2013 whatever it took to entertain his fellow citizens while making him one of his country\u2019s first millionaires.With P.T. America\u2019s Greatest Showman, the Messrs Kunhardt rediscover the genius and vision of an unmatched impresario and entrepreneur. In vivid words and spellbinding pictures (more than 500 photographs, engravings, and color lithographs from 41 different archives), we meet a man of complex motives, a master of merchandise, an inveterate self-promoter often reviled for his opportunism. We meet the man who did NOT say \"There\u2019s a sucker born every minute\"; whose best friends were clergymen; whose autobiography sold more than a million copies; who took a public leap through a flaming hoop to prove to the ASPCA that his performing horses were in no danger; who (allegedly) plotted with Samuel Clemens to lease a comet\u2019s tail to take a million passengers on a guided tour of outer space. We meet the man who built his reputation \u2013 and his fortune \u2013 largely on the exoticism of others, but whose crowning moment as a member of the Connecticut state legislature came in a speech in favor of the constitutional amendment to abolish \"A human soul is not to be trifled with. It may inhabit the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hotentot \u2013 it is still an immortal spirit!\"There is no denying Barnum\u2019s abiding influence, more than a century after his death, on our popular culture. For better AND for worse, we owe America\u2019s irrepressible infatuation with show biz largely to him.",

        "description": "How New York City subways signage evolved from a \u201cvisual mess\u201d to a uniform system with Helvetica triumphant. For years, the signs in the New York City subway system were a bewildering hodge-podge of lettering styles, sizes, shapes, materials, colors, and messages. The original mosaics (dating from as early as 1904), displaying a variety of serif and sans serif letters and decorative elements, were supplemented by signs in terracotta and cut stone. Over the years, enamel signs identifying stations and warning riders not to spit, smoke, or cross the tracks were added to the mix. Efforts to untangle this visual mess began in the mid-1960s, when the city transit authority hired the design firm Unimark International to create a clear and consistent sign system. We can see the results today in the white-on-black signs throughout the subway system, displaying station names, directions, and instructions in crisp Helvetica. This book tells the story of how typographic order triumphed over chaos. The process didn't go smoothly or quickly. At one point New York Times architecture writer Paul Goldberger declared that the signs were so confusing one almost wished that they weren't there at all. Legend has it that Helvetica came in and vanquished the competition. Paul Shaw shows that it didn't happen that way\u2014that, in fact, for various reasons (expense, the limitations of the transit authority sign shop), the typeface overhaul of the 1960s began not with Helvetica but with its forebear, Standard (AKA Akzidenz Grotesk). It wasn't until the 1980s and 1990s that Helvetica became ubiquitous. Shaw describes the slow typographic changeover (supplementing his text with more than 250 images\u2014photographs, sketches, type samples, and documents). He places this signage evolution in the context of the history of the New York City subway system, of 1960s transportation signage, of Unimark International, and of Helvetica itself.",

Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. These daemons are pervasive and, for the most part, benign.But the same can't always be said for the people who design them.Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer -- the billionare architect behind half a dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed millions of gamers around the world. But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events that may unravel the fabric of the hyperefficient, interconnected world Sobol left behind.With Sobol's secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy -- or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control.",

        "description": "Owing to its bizarre nature and its implications for understanding how brains work, synesthesia has recently received a lot of attention in the popular press and motivated a great deal of research and discussion among scientists. The questions generated by these two communities are Does the synesthetic phenomenon require awareness and attention? How does a feature that is not present become bound to one that is? Does synesthesia develop or is it hard wired? Should it change our way of thinking about perceptual experience in general? What is its value in understanding perceptual systems as a whole?This volume brings together a distinguished group of investigators from diverse backgrounds--among them neuroscientists, novelists, and synesthetes themselves--who provide fascinating answers to these questions. Although each approaches synesthesia from a very different perspective, and each was curious about and investigated synesthesia for very different reasons, the similarities between their work cannot be ignored. The research presented in this volume demonstrates that it is no longer reasonable to ask whether or not synesthesia is real--we must now ask how we can account for it from cognitive, neurobiological, developmental, and evolutionary perspectives. This book will be important reading for any scientist interested in brain and mind, not to mention synesthetes themselves, and others who might be wondering what all the fuss is about.",

On a night where she didn't even know how she was going to make rent, she got lucky as an extra shift came up at the diner, effectively keeping her off the street.But when she came home after her shift, her room was a mess and she realized her roommate had a party with a bunch of people over. Looking through her tip stash she realized someone had taken all the cash she had been saving to cover rent.With her back against the wall, she searched through the paper, looking for any acting gigs which could give her some quick cash. But a rather unusual ad catches her attention instead. The ad was looking for healthy females her age who would act as a surrogate to wealthy clients. With no other options she decides to contact the agency and see what they can offer her.After going through the proposals she finds one potential surrogacy match with a single male in Texas. Only this surrogate contract is a little different, in that the client is also looking for a \"paper marriage\" as well. She wonders why, but considering how much they were offering she agreed.A week later she finds herself on a flight to Texas headed towards a ranch to become the surrogate and wife to a wealthy Texas rodeo star. She arrives and the lady of the house fills her in on the current situation. It seems like the cowboy's father had passed away, and left him their family ranch on one condition, that he get married and have a child within the year.Jasmine finally meets Parker, her soon to be husband and client, and he lets her know this is strictly a business relationship. After the baby arrives and the ranch is transferred over to him they can dissolve the marriage and he would raise the child on his own.But what he wasn't expecting was that love had bigger plans for them. While at first they were very formal with each other, as the days went by their infatuation continued to grow.Their love grew stronger day by day, until a terrible accident threatened to keep them apart...Will the power of love overcome adversity and bring them back together?Read this complete standalone NOVEL to the end right now by scrolling up and clicking \"Buy Now With 1 Click!\" or \"Read for FREE with KINDLE UNLIMITED\"This hot and steamy BWWM romance is for adult audiences 18+ only",

These bonobos, like others of their species, are capable of reason and carrying on deep relationships - but unlike most bonobos, they also know American Sign Language.Isabel Duncan, a scientist at the Great Ape Language Lab, doesn't understand people, but animals she gets - especially the bonobos. Isabel feels more comfortable in their world than she's ever felt among humans\u2026 until she meets John Thigpen, a very married reporter who braves the ever-present animal rights protesters outside the lab to see what's really going on inside.When an explosion rocks the lab, severely injuring Isabel and \"liberating\" the apes, John's human interest piece turns into the story of a lifetime, one he'll risk his career and his marriage to follow. Then a reality TV show featuring the missing apes debuts under mysterious circumstances, and it immediately becomes the biggest - and unlikeliest - phenomenon in the history of modern media. Millions of fans are glued to their screens watching the apes order greasy take-out, have generous amounts of sex, and sign for Isabel to come get them. Now, to save her family of apes from this parody of human life, Isabel must connect with her own kind, including John, a green-haired vegan, and a retired porn star with her own agenda.Ape House delivers great entertainment, but it also opens the animal world to us in ways few novels have done, securing Sara Gruen's place as a master storyteller who allows us to see ourselves as we never have before.From the Hardcover edition.",

        "description": "Three years ago, while on a vacation with extended family, my three daughters-in-law and I were talking about the relationship difficulties so many mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law have. We figured at least part of the reason for that could be attributed to the fact that a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law love the same man-one tends to see him as someone she should help protect, and the other perceives him as her protector. Such very different viewpoints are a set up for relationship issues. So, we wondered out loud, \"Why do we all get along so well?\" The four of us are Christians and that certainly lays a wonderful groundwork for the potential for good relationships, but we are not similar in personality or passions. And to say our tastes in music, literature, fashion, politics, or childrearing are varied would be an understatement-but get along, we do! In fact, we truly love each other. So, we did what in hindsight seems impossible-we four women wrote a book! Well, to be more exact, we wrote two books in one! Lisa, Rhonda, and Lizzy's side of the book is entitled \"Why Her? You, Your Mother-In-Law, And The Big Picture.\" My side of the book is entitled \"Why Her? You, Your Daughter-In-Law, And The Big Picture.\" Our book isn't a \"how to\" book, but a \"why to\" book. We chose that emphasis because we think that if a woman knows why a good relationship matters, she is better equipped to design her role in her relationships in a way that can make those relationships better. We hope you will find the book to be helpful and an entertaining read. -- Becky Hunter, co-author of \"Why Her?\"",

But what if it were all true? What if there was such a place, and a poor, broken priest once stumbled past its borders, discovering, not a Christian paradise, but a country where everything is possible, immortality is easily had, and the Western world is nothing but a dim and distant dream?Brother Hiob of Luzerne, on missionary work in the Himalayan wilderness on the eve of the eighteenth century, discovers a village guarding a miraculous tree whose branches sprout books instead of fruit. These strange books chronicle the history of the kingdom of Prester John, and Hiob becomes obsessed with the tales they tell.The Habitation of the Blessedrecounts the fragmented narratives found within these living volumes, revealing the life of a priest named John, and his rise to power in this country of impossible richness. John's tale weaves together with the confessions of his wife Hagia, a blemmye--a headless creature who carried her face on her chest--as well as the tender, jeweled nursery stories of Imtithal, nanny to the royal family.",

        "description": "One hundred years ago Sigmund Freud publishedThe Interpretations of Dreams, a book that, like Darwin'sThe Origin of Species, revolutionized our understanding of human nature. Now this groundbreaking new translation--the first to be based on the original text published in November 1899--brings us a more readable, more accurate, and more coherent picture of Freud's masterpiece.The first edition ofThe Interpretation of Dreamsis much shorter than its subsequent editions; each time the text was reissued, from 1909 onwards, Freud added to it. The most significant, and in many ways the most unfortunate addition, is a 50-page section devoted to the kind of mechanical reading of dream symbolism--long objects equal male genitalia, etc.--that has gained popular currency and partially obscured Freud's more profound insights into dreams. In the original version presented here, Freud's emphasis falls more clearly on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Without the strata of later additions, readers will find here a clearer development of Freud's central ideas--of dream as wish-fulfillment, of the dream's manifest and latent content, of the retelling of dreams as a continuation of the dreamwork, and much more. Joyce Crick's translation is lighter and faster-moving than previous versions, enhancing the sense of dialogue with the reader, one of Freud's stylistic strengths, and allowing us to follow Freud's theory as it evolved through difficult cases, apparently intractable counter-examples, and fascinating analyses of Freud's own dreams.The restoration of Freud's classic is a major event, giving us in a sense a new work by one of this century' most startling, original, and influential thinkers.",

        "description": "The Shadow of the Almighty introduces readers to the nature of God by exploring the biblical references to God as \"Father\", \"Son\", and \"Holy Spirit\". This fruitful approach offers fresh insight into the meaning of the biblical language used for God, giving readers the background necessary for properly understanding the trinitarian perspective of the New Testament and of the Christian faith\". \"Divided into four chapters, the book looks at \"Father\" language in early Judaism, at \"Father\" language in early Christianity, at \"Son\" language, and at language designating the Spirit. This thorough review of the traditional God language across the biblical texts shows what the earliest Christians understood by using these terms and, ultimately, what these terms mean for modern faith and practice\". \"While much of this material is deceptively familiar, the authors' close examination of how and where the different terms are used reveals some surprising results. It makes clear, for example, that speaking of God in trinitarian terms was not as radical a departure from early Jewish monotheism as many have thought, and it shows that while early Christianity was characterized by disparate ideas, the first Christians nevertheless shared a common understanding of God. Equally engaging findings of the book include the authors' support for the traditional gendered term \"Father\" when speaking about God\". Complete with helpful questions at the end of each chapter, The Shadow of the Almighty provides an excellent place to begin a deeper study of God.",

Their lives and best deeds have been remembered in various addresses upon the opposite side of the river, and sometimes on these shores. We give all due honor to their memories, all just praise to their Virtues, and all glory to their example. The work of these simple men, in the most tryrng period of the Revolution, is so wrought into the history of the nation that it has became one of its chief transactions. It is enough to say that the three men proved to be above temptation, if we are to believe the best evidences before us. We must, however, regret that men like Andre, and his friend Major Talhnadge, ever doubt ed. The integrity of the captors and regret also that the record was published more than once that they Were self appointed to the office of stopping well-dressed travellers, and men who perhaps would have ri\ufb02ed a traveller. It is a duty to say that Paulding had been twice captured by the British army, that Williams was but twenty - two years old, and the eldest of his three companions. Though young in years and poor in purse, they were rich in mature judgment, and in their work performed a service of immense value.",

        "description": "The Good Life Elsewhere is a very funny book. It is also a very sad one. Moldovan writer Vladimir Lorchenkov tells the story of a group of villagers and their tragicomic efforts, against all odds and at any cost, to emigrate from Europe\u2019s most impoverished nation to Italy for work. The Good Life Elsewhere aims to present the complexity of a new Europe, where allegiances shift but memories are rooted in place. The book integrates small-scale human follies with strategic partnerships, unification plans, and the Soviet legacies that still hang over the former Eastern Bloc. Lorchenkov addresses the vexing question of what to do when many formerly pro-Soviet/pro-Russia countries want to link arms with their Western European brethren. In this uproarious tale, an Orthodox priest is deserted by his wife for an art-dealing atheist; a mechanic redesigns his tractor for travel by air and sea; thousands of villagers take to the road on a modern-day religious crusade to make it to the promised land of Italy; meanwhile, politicians remain politicians.Like many great satirists from Voltaire to Gogol to Vonnegut, Lorchenkov makes use of the grotesque to both horrify us and help us laugh. It is not often that stories from forgotten countries such as Moldova reach us in the English-speaking world. A country where 25 percent of its population works abroad, where remittances make up nearly 40 percent of the GDP, where alcohol consumption per capita is the highest in the world, and which has the lowest per capita income in all of Europe \u2013 this is a country that surely has its problems. But, as Lorchenkov vividly shows, it\u2019s a country whose residents don\u2019t easily give up.Russian critics have praised Lorchenkov\u2019s work, calling this novel \u201ca bleeding, wild work, grotesque in every twist of its plot and in every character, written brightly, bitterly, humorously, and \u2013 paradoxically, as we\u2019re dealing with the grotesque \u2013 honestly.\u201d In The Good Life Elsewhere, Vladimir Lorchenkov shows himself to be a fearless critic, an enduring optimist, and a master stylist. And he does it all \u201cin vivid colors, with a pamphleteer\u2019s spite, and a good-humored smile.\u201d",

        "description": "Sexual contact between humans and animals, commonly known as bestiality, has long been condemned by the conventions of society. Despite the dread and loathing usually associated with such conduct, the incidence of bestiality, especially in rural communities, is not as rare as most people assume. The Horseman is a completely candid, sometimes graphic, sexual autobiography of one man's struggle to come to terms with the private demon of bestiality. Mark Matthews traces his obsession with horses through his teen years, troubled marriage, his experiences as a parent, and his eventual divorce. The underlying problem and his attempt to deny it led him to drug abuse, self-loathing, and the brink of suicide, before he finally came to accept himself as he is and to leave guilt behind.",

        "description": "Many churches aspire to be more culturally diverse-but they find that they have no idea how to approach that goal practically. This book addresses that problem with ten ways churches can truly engage and welcome other cultures.In 2014 Douglas Brouwer, a seasoned American pastor, took on the unique challenge of serving a multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural church in one of Europe's largest cities. In this book Brouwer distills the lessons he has learned from that experience into timely wisdom on issues every multicultural church faces, including language barriers, theological differences, and cultural stereotypes. Honestly recounting his own questions and challenges in multicultural ministry, Brouwer shows how churches everywhere can adjust their attitudes and practices to embrace racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity.",

        "description": "This beautifully illustrated book showcases the works of one of Sri Landa's most influential architects--Anjaledran, an ethnic Tamil and visionary artist.During the past 25 years of civil war in Sri Lanka, Anjalendran has stayed on, creating architecture that has attracted interest across the entire Indian subcontinent. In Anjalendran , David Robson explores this unique man and his uncommon vision. Anjalendran's buildings have a simple directness, and although totally modern in spirit, they acknowledge the rich design traditions of Sri Lanka. Whether working with ample budgets or at rock bottom cost (like his SOS Children's Village orphanages), his work focuses not only on creative buildings, but--a la Frank Lloyd Wright--also their landscaping, furniture and decoration.Just as interesting as the architecture is the process by which Anjalendran works\u2014:from home, never employing more than four student assistants, with no office, no secretary, no car and no cell phone. He operates without a bank account and has never signed a contract with either a client or a builder. With stunning color photographs, plan details and behind-the-scenes insights, Anjalendran sheds light on the works of this exceptional man.",

These letters give a fascinating glimpse into the mind of an eccentric genius. Collected here for the first time are more than forty of Nikola Tesla's letters. The subject matter ranges widely, as Tesla was interested in almost everything. In these letters he responds to Marconi and Edison, gives his thoughts on the wars of his day, corrects inconsistencies in news reports, and much much more. Nikola Tesla has been called the most important man of the 20th Century. Without Tesla's ground-breaking work we' d all be sitting in the dark without even a radio to listen to.",

        "description": "Phil Robertson is an American hunting enthusiast, businessman and reality television star who has a net worth of $15 million.Phil Robertson is the patriarch of the Robertson family which owns and operates a multi-million dollar hunting accessory company called Duck Commander.Phil Robertson attended Louisiana Tech on a football scholarship where he was the starting quarterback and star of the football team.He actually started ahead of future NFL hall of famer Terry Bradshaw.Upon graduation Phil had the option to play football professionally but declined because he didn't want to miss duck hunting season.After graduating with both an undergraduate and Master\u2019s degree in education, Phil initially supported his family as a teacher.He also spent time as a commercial fisherman.In 1972, Phil was inspired to invent a new kind of duck hunting call that was a vast improvement over the standard call at the time.The Duck Commander Duck call eventually became the gold standard duck whistle among professional hunters.Today Phil owns and operates the business alongside his four sons, and wife Kay who have all helped turn Duck Commander into a thriving multi-million dollar business empire that includes DVDs, merchandise, books and more.The family and business got so popular that they got their very own reality show on A&E called Duck Dynasty.Duck Dynasty has grown to become one of the most popular shows on television with over 8 million people tuning in to each episode.As of December 2013, Duck Dynasty has aired over 50 episodes over four seasons.Phil's memoir \"Happy, Happy, Happy\" was a #1 best seller and has sold close to one million copies to date. Prior to the success of their reality show, the Robertson's company sold roughly 60,000 Duck Commander calls per year.In 2012 they sold 600,000.During the annual 10 week duck hunting season, Phil has a tradition of not showering or shaving ever to bring him luck.On December 18, 2013, Phil found himself in hot water after a controversial interview with the magazine GQ was made public.Within the interview, Phil made some comments that were perceived as homophobic.Phil was quick to apologize and insists that he loves and respects every kind of person in the world.In response, A&E was forced to suspend Phil from the show indefinitely.And by indefinitely, apparently they meant roughly one week because on December 28th, 2013 A&E announced they were lifting their suspension after being bombarded with complaints from fans of the show.",

When an irascible elderly local is accused of poisoning a trout stream, Les and Becky are plunged into deep and dangerous waters, forced to navigate currents of disillusionment and betrayal that will force them to question themselves and test their tentative bond\u2014and threaten to carry them over the edge.Echoing the heartbreaking beauty of William Faulkner and the spiritual isolation of Carson McCullers,Above the Waterfalldemonstrates once again the prodigious talent of \u201ca gorgeous, brutal writer\u201d (Richard Price) hailed as \u201cone of the great American authors at work today\u201d (Janet Maslin,New York Times).",

        "description": "In the spirit of her blockbuster #1 New York Times bestseller The Happiness Project, Gretchen Rubin embarks on a new project to make home a happier place.One Sunday afternoon, as she unloaded the dishwasher, Gretchen Rubin felt hit by a wave of homesickness. Homesick\u2014why? She was standing right in her own kitchen. She felt homesick, she realized, with love for home itself. \u201cOf all the elements of a happy life,\u201d she thought, \u201cmy home is the most important.\u201d In a flash, she decided to undertake a new happiness project, and this time, to focus on home.And what did she want from her home? A place that calmed her, and energized her. A place that, by making her feel safe, would free her to take risks. Also, while Rubin wanted to be happier at home, she wanted to appreciate how much happiness was there already.So, starting in September (the new January), Rubin dedicated a school year\u2014September through May\u2014to making her home a place of greater simplicity, comfort, and love.In The Happiness Project, she worked out general theories of happiness. Here she goes deeper on factors that matter for home, such as possessions, marriage, time, and parenthood. How can she control the cubicle in her pocket? How might she spotlight her family\u2019s treasured possessions? And it really was time to replace that dud toaster.Each month, Rubin tackles a different theme as she experiments with concrete, manageable resolutions\u2014and this time, she coaxes her family to try some resolutions, as well.With her signature blend of memoir, science, philosophy, and experimentation, Rubin\u2019s passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire readers to find more happiness in their own lives.",

        "description": "For Waldemar Leverkuhn the day could not have begun more auspiciously. He and three of his friends, all retirees, have just won the lottery. It\u2019s a modest sum when split four ways\u2014certainly not enough to lift Waldemar out of the plain apartment he shares with his quiet, weary wife\u2014but it\u2019s enough for the old men to toast their good luck with a blowout at their favorite bar. The celebration ends, however, with Waldemar drunk, stumbling, belligerent, and eventually dead in his own bed, stabbed twenty-eight times in the chest with a carving knife.Taking charge of the case is Intendent M\u00fcnster, Chief Inspector Van Veeteren\u2019s longtime right-hand man, and his beguiling colleague Ewa Moreno. They seem to have a surefire lead with the disappearance of one of Waldemar\u2019s friends on the same night as the murder, but after a cursory look into his whereabouts produces more questions than answers, the investigation suddenly seems to solve itself when Marie-Louise Leverkuhn, Waldemar\u2019s wife, confesses to the crime and calmly resigns herself to her fate. The case is, but all accounts, closed. That is, until one of the Leverkuhns\u2019 neighbors in the same unassuming block of apartments goes missing and turns up\u2014spectacularly, gruesomely\u2014in pieces around the city.Thrown back into the fog and chasing after wisps of clues that tenuously but inextricably link the murders, M\u00fcenster and Moreno take center stage in H\u00e5kan Nesser\u2019s haunting new addition to his acclaimed series.",

After the senseless murder of his pregnant wife, Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley hands in his badge and walks out of Scotland Yard. He goes home to Cornwall. The only way he can deal with his painful memories is to hike the trails over the cliffs of the Cornish coast. There, on the forty-third day of his walk, he finds the lifeless body of a young man, dead from a fall. Thus begins a quest to unmask a clever and ruthless murderer. But this time, Lynley\u2019s not in charge. He\u2019s a witness\u2014and possibly even a suspect.

        "description": "Nietzsches Verm\u00e4chtnis, das seine ber\u00fchmteste Sammlung von Aphorismen auf den Punkt bringt, ist der Nihilismus als lebensbejahende Kraft. Er ist die Voraussetzung f\u00fcr die Entfaltung eines neuen und befreiten Lebens. Denn nur die Zerschlagung des alten Denkens in Kunst, Religion und Moral gibt dem \"freien Geist\" die M\u00f6glichkeit, in ironischer Distanz zu sich und der Welt die \u00fcberlieferten Illusionen zu \u00fcberwinden (\"Gott ist tot\") und zu den eigentlichen Werten, dem besten Teil seiner diesseitigen Existenz vorzudringen. Dieser geistigen Haltung entspricht das aphoristische Denken Nietzsches, das starre Begriffe und Systeme meidet: Die Suche nach Wahrheit geschieht im befreiten Raum der Gedanken und setzt auf die aktive Mitarbeit der Leser.",

        "description": "By turns tender and terrifying, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff captures America on the verge of political upheaval in 2016 and introduces us to a man who just might be able to save us from the oncoming horror. Yes, Bob Honey - carnival carny, sewage specialist, and government operative, among other occupations - has spent years in preparation, crisscrossing the world in the employ of a mysterious government program that pays in small bills. He stopped in New Orleans to help Katrina victims; traveled to Baghdad, Beirut, South Sudan, and elsewhere on sewage emergencies; and submerged himself in the Pacific Ocean in search of sea life - all while living out of a quiet house on a residential street in Woodview, California, where he sometimes disturbs the neighbors with the sound of his lawn mower.Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff marks the debut of a dazzling literary talent. With comic bravado and an urgent agenda, Pappy Pariah has created a haunting, hilarious vision of an American middle-aged man with a mission - a loner struggling to find truth amid the chaos of a political campaign that threatens to destroy the values of the country he loves.Bringing Pariah's revelatory prose to life is actor, director, and filmmaker Sean Penn (Mystic River, Milk, Dead Man Walking), whose knack for choosing nuanced roles and delivering emotionally rich character studies finds an apt bedfellow in Bob Honey. Penn's distinct voice - here, an expertly crafted tightrope walk between oddball jocularity and grave prophecy - perfectly captures the caustic truth telling of Pariah's message. With brazen and unabashed affection for Pariah's hero, Penn takes the story of Bob Honey to dizzying new heights.About the Pappy Pariah was disputably born in Summerton Feathers, Iowa, in the year of our Lord 1960. He has written voluminous travelogues and articles under a pseudonym for many mainstream American press outlets. At the age of 13, his appendix exploded while he was playing flag football, and it was during treatment for extreme peritonitis that he was first driven to put pen to paper. This is his first work of fiction.",

If you're looking for a heart-pounder, this is it.\" S.B. StinnetThe castle of 15th century duchess Elizabeth Laskaar looks down on the little Swiss village of Murdenwald and the secretive military complex nearby. There, the UN hopes to end world conflict with a vast military simulation that will dramatize the apocalypse that will follow the next major war. To head the project, they hire notorious Hollywood producer Donald Vito, master of explosive action adventures, who still mourns the murder of his teenage love in the 1950s.Vito and the simulation team use new technology to build hundreds of virtual soldiers and terrorists you can touch, speak to, and reason with. But they also begin to feel the influence of Elizabeth Laskaar. She\u2019s often called Bloody Bess \u2013 the first real vampire \u2013 because she maintained her youthful beauty by slaughtering her maidservants and bathing in their blood. Recklessly inspired by their surroundings, the team creates a virtual vampire that soon takes on the characteristics of Elizabeth\u2019s magnificent, long-dead husband. Soon, he and Bess stalk the compound, seducing everyone working on the project, until vampire blood surges beyond the humans to the virtual characters with unthinkable consequences. In the end, perhaps, only the power of Vito\u2019s long lost love can save humanity.",

It was originally published inThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fictionin 1973 before appearing in this collection.Cold Hand in Minestands as one of Aickman's best collections and contains eight stories that show off his powers as a 'strange story' writer to the full, being more ambiguous than standard ghost stories. Throughout the stories the reader is introduced to a variety of characters, from a man who spends the night in a Hospice to a German aristocrat and a woman who sees an image of her own soul. There is also a nod to the conventional vampire story ('Pages from a Young Girl's Journal') but all the stories remain unconventional and inconclusive, which perhaps makes them all the more startling and intriguing.'Of all the authors of uncanny tales, Aickman is the best ever . . . His tales literally haunt me; his plots and his turns of phrase run through my head at the most unlikely moments.' Russell Kirk",

It was, in fact, despite herself that the young Bavarian duchess, who had always been somewhat rebellious and untamed, was courted by the Emperor of Austria, one of Europe\u2019s most powerful men, whom she finally accepted to marry. Attempting by all means to get away from the Imperial Court, this Hungarian queen of legendary beauty will carry the weight of the Crown of the Habsburgs throughout her adult life. Sissi does not adapt well to the strict etiquette of the imperial life, and the several moments she spends away from her husband are difficult. A romantic liaison with an enemy count will serve as a rare source of comfort for the empress. An unhappy sovereign, Sissi is nevertheless idolized by her people and becomes the main unifying actor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Alone at the head of a kingdom and hounded by her admirers, she will die a tragic death at the hands of a fanatic.",

Che si combattano guerre imperiali o guerre domestiche, in gioco c'\u00e8 sempre la libert\u00e0 e il senso da dare a questa parola.Nove anni dopoLe correzioni, Jonathan Franzen torna con un romanzo spietato e divertente, un vasto affresco storico capace di un'umanissima, malinconica attenzione per il dettaglio: una riflessione sulla libert\u00e0 e sulle cose cui siamo disposti a rinunciare per essa, sull'ambiguit\u00e0 di un diritto che a volte si fonda sulla sopraffazione dell'altro, sulle catene che ci imprigionano e su quelle che in realt\u00e0 ci rendono pi\u00f9 liberi. Ma questo \u00e8 anche un romanzo sul matrimonio, su ci\u00f2 che ci lega a un'altra persona, e sulla politica, che \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che ci lega a tutti gli uomini. Sul desiderio e il risentimento, sull'invidia che fonda le amicizie, sul conformismo della societ\u00e0 di massa e sulle aspettative deluse: tutte cose che, a ben vedere, sono modi diversi di pensare la libert\u00e0.",

This faraway land is a frontier of new technology such as air travel, loops in time and a society apparently flourishing without a governing body of any kind.On the surface, everyone appears to thrive in this liberated society, but this kind of free thinking is fertile ground for the Dark Master and his followers. Just when Rhuna and her family settle into their beautiful new lakeside home, strange things begin to happen. Powerful conjurers cause upheaval with their sinister magic, driving people from their homes.An isolated society claiming to adhere to the ways of the First Atlans, appear to be fighting a losing battle against these followers of the Dark Master. While attempting to find a diplomatic solution to the escalating conflict, Rhuna faces great challenges in her personal life. Aradin\u2019s love for her has cooled off inexplicably, and Lozira\u2019s emotional wellbeing teeters on a precarious threshold. In desperation, Rhuna combines her magical powers and Varappan technology to do the unthinkable. What she does, however, is forbidden, and brings about a rift between her and her own father.

In addition to colorful accounts of the massive westward migration, the California Gold Rush, a war with Mexico, the Oregon boundary conflict, Texasand the Alamo, Liberty for All? takes a deep look at the issue that began to gnaw at the country's How, in the land where \"all men are created equal,\" could there be slaves?",

Growing Up Nigger Rich is a sign, if read carefully, that will let you know what's around you and what it might do to you. What a great book for people, no matter their race, who grew up 'nigger rich' and didn't even know it.\"--Nikki Giovanni, poet\"Nigger rich\" is a colloquialism encompassing class distinctions, a term used mainly by African Americans in reference toother African Americans, with an intent similar to that of other people's use of the term \"nigger\" to refer to any person of color. It was, and remains, an expression of fear, of anger, and of envy. Through the complex web of this narrative, Gwendoline Y. Fortune juxtaposes \"old South\" and new, privilege and powerlessness, and various visions of racial identity in this refreshing, heartbreaking novel about growing up and coming home. From the moment Gayla Tyner returns to her hometown of Carolton, South Carolina after thirty years away \"up north,\" she is struck by the reminders of her segregated youth. As she seeks to ease the pain of having grown up \"nigger rich\"--with relative privilege in someplaces, reviled and teased in others--she must also come to terms with her philandering husband, domineering father, and all of the relationships, secrets, and pleasures that continue to call her home.",

        "description": "When Alice Bliss learns that her father, Matt, is being deployed to Iraq, she's heartbroken. Alice idolizes her father, loves working beside him in their garden, accompanying him on the occasional roofing job, playing baseball. When he ships out, Alice is faced with finding a way to fill the emptiness he has left behind.Matt will miss seeing his daughter blossom from a tomboy into a full-blown teenager. Alice will learn to drive, join the track team, go to her first dance, and fall in love, all while trying to be strong for her mother, Angie, and take care of her precocious little sister, Ellie. But the smell of Matt is starting to fade from his blue shirt that Alice wears everyday, and the phone calls are never long enough.Alice Blissis a profoundly moving coming-of-age novel about love and its many variations--the support of a small town looking after its own; love between an absent father and his daughter; the complicated love between an adolescent girl and her mother; and an exploration of new love with the boy-next-door. These characters' struggles amidst uncertain times echo our own, lending the novel an immediacy and poignancy that is both relevant and real. At once universal and very personal,Alice Blissis a transforming story about those who are left at home during wartime, and a teenage girl bravely facing the future.",

Having gained a hesitant acceptance from Fawn's family for their unlikely marriage, the couple hopes to find a similar reception among Dag's Lakewalker kin. But their arrival is met with prejudice and suspicion, setting many in the camp against them, including Dag's own mother and brother. A faction of Hickory Lake Camp, denying the literal bond between Dag and Fawn, woven in blood in the Lakewalker magical way, even goes so far as to threaten permanent exile for Dag.Before their fate as a couple is decided, however, Dag is called away by an unexpected--and viciously magical--malice attack on a neighboring hinterland threatening Lakewalkers and farmers both. What his patrol discovers there will not only change Dag and his new bride, but will call into question the uneasy relationship between their peoples--and may even offer a glimmer of hope for a less divided future.Filled with heroic deeds, wondrous magic, and rich, all-too-human characters, \"The Sharing Knife: Legacy\" is at once a gripping adventure and a poignant romance from one of the most imaginative and thoughtful writers in fantasy today.",

        "description": "Published to coincide with the centenary of Tolstoy's death, here is an exciting new edition of one of the great literary works of world literature. Tolstoy's epic masterpiece captures with unprecedented immediacy the broad sweep of life during the Napoleonic wars and the brutal invasion ofRussia. Balls and soir\u00e9es, the burning of Moscow, the intrigues of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles, the quiet moments of everyday life--all in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The Maudes' translation of Tolstoy's epic masterpiece has long beenconsidered the best English version, and now for the first time it has been revised to bring it fully into line with modern approaches to the text. French passages are restored, Anglicization of Russian names removed, and outmoded expressions updated. A new introduction by Amy Mandelker considersthe novel's literary and historical context, the nature of the work, and Tolstoy's artistic and philosophical aims. New, expanded notes provide historical background and identifications, as well as insight into Russian life and society.",

Es el inicio de un amor desesperante, cargado de expectativas e ilusiones vanas, destinado a durar lo que dura una estaci\u00f3n.

But before she gets ahead of herself, her girlfriends convince her she needs to let down her hair for once, meet a hot guy and let the moment take over . . .After graduating from an Ivy League law school and practicing in New York for a few years, the plan for Foster Deacon was to return home to Denver and join the family firm, marry the right woman, shoulder his responsibilities. Except Foster's always been a bit of a rebel, and he's decided to suit up with his family's rival firm. What better way to celebrate than to spend a night with a gorgeous blonde who leaves before he could say, \"Good morning . . .\"Becky feels she did the right thing, leaving her lover's bed and not her number. After all, she needs to focus on her job at Glassmeyer & Polak--until the new hire walks through the door . . . with a bad case of happily ever after.Praise for Sarah Title's Southern Comfort Romance series\"Sexy and made me laugh!\" --Smexy Books\"A fast-paced read that provided just as many smiles from the humor as it did sizzles from the romance.\" --The Book Divas Reads\"Wild, witty, and wonderful.\"--New York Timesbestselling author Jo Goodman\"Quite a sexy book.\"--USAToday.com",

Como cazador solitario que no ahorra esfuerzos ni amenazas, se ha hecho a\u00fan m\u00e1s peligroso para la logia secreta de Belial. En el curso del siglo XX, el lord de las sombras y sus hermanos de logia conspiran para llevar a la humanidad a su destrucci\u00f3n a fin de fundar un nuevo linaje pretendidamente puro. S\u00f3lo David Camden se interpone en su diab\u00f3lico plan. Sus dones especiales han madurado y hacen del Lobo Blanco una maldici\u00f3n invisible que asesta golpes cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s certeros a la hermandad de Belial. Hasta el poderoso lord de las sombras debe temer a este mortal, porque David conoce su tal\u00f3n de Aquiles.En esta tercera parte, Ralf Isau presenta un cautivador retrato del siglo X. Su h\u00e9roe hace que el lector sufra y est\u00e9 en vilo junto a \u00e9l, olvidando los l\u00edmites entre ficci\u00f3n y realidad.",

        "description": "No twentieth-century woman/teacher has provoked as much interest and perplexity as Sylvia Ashton-Warner (1908-1984). Her life reveals the fascinating dilemmas of classroom erotics, the dangers of intimacy in teaching and learning, the difficult and ambiguous nature of post-heterosexual attachments in women\u2019s biographies, and the powerful fantasy that the objects of teaching lives are other than our own teaching selves. Sylvia Ashton-Warner and Excitability in Education provides a groundbreaking and timely feminist re-visioning of Ashton-Warner. This book speaks not only to her enigmatic survivals, but also to education\u2019s own submission to excitability and provocation.",

But unlike the contents of Pandora's box that plaque human world, the demons shot out the hall like golden rays and changed into 108 heroes scattered over vast land of China. Their deeds formed the heroic legend of a grand scale, which was recorded in Water Margin, one of the four greatest Chinese classical novels. The heroes upheld justice and helped the weak and the poor. They gathered on Liangshan Mountain and fought against the corrupt imperial government under the slogan \"Right wrongs in accordance with heaven's decree\". The six-volume Water Margin illustrated by cartoonist Teo Seng Hock presents vivid scenes in this drama of valour and brings alive the heroic legend.",

Readers can enjoy the series in any order.Rachel has always been more comfortable dating blue collar than billionaires, but the one guy pursuing her just happens to be the latter. Feeling out of her league, she turns to someone who might have good advice. Her sexy, Italian tycoon boss Damiano. And why not? He's likely dated half the socialites in New York. Surely he'll have tips to offer in spades.Damiano Mantovani has kept his P.A. in the Do Not Seduce category of his brain -- after all she is his best friend's sister -- but when Rachel asks for help on 'dating someone like him', he suspects a ruse to take things beyond a working relationship. The idea intrigues him more than he's ever let himself admit.Soon it becomes evident the competition is real and Rachel is quickly moved from off limits, to the Must Seduce category of his brain. He moves stealthily to stake the first claim, planning to give Rachel lessons that will go beyond ballrooms and into the bedroom.",

She has been responsible strictly for the cooking and cleaning, but the recession has hit, and suddenly Araceli is the last Mexican standing\u2014unless you count Scott Torres, though you'd never suspect he was half Mexican but for his last name and an old family photo with central LA in the background. The financial pressure is causing the kind of fights that even Araceli knows the children shouldn't hear, and then one morning, after a particularly dramatic fight, Araceli wakes to an empty house\u2014except for the two Torres-Thompson boys, little aliens she's never had to interact with before. Their parents are unreachable, and the only family member she knows of is Se\u00f1or Torres, the subject of that old family photo. So she does the only thing she can think of and heads to the bus stop to seek out their grandfather. It will be an adventure, she tells the boys. If she only knew.With a precise eye for the telling detail and an unerring way with character, soaring brilliantly and seamlessly among a panorama of viewpoints, Tobar calls on all of his experience\u2014as a novelist, a father, a journalist, a son of Guatemalan immigrants, and a native Angeleno\u2014to deliver a novel as broad, as essential, as alive as the city itself.",

        "description": "Multiplied millions of women all over the world are looking over the church's shoulder, longing to see the freedom Jesus purchased for them at Calvary. Millions more have found freedom in Jesus but are still bound by human ideas-ideas that pressure a woman to let culture, not God, determine her place in the Kingdom.While hurting men and women are outside the church cry out, \"Is there any hope? Does anyone care?\" their sisters in the church are asking, \"How can I share the hope I have\" How can I, a woman, serve the Lord?\" Many women, having heard God call them into public roles in the Kingdom, are serving in positions of leadership. They are asking, \"Will the church support us?\"We must respond. The issue of women in missions, ministry, and leadership is dividing homes, churches, communities, even societies. We must respond responsibly, for we never want to find ourselves working against God's purposes, quenching His Spirit at work in the lives of those He has called. We must respond carefully, since God's truth often stands in direct opposition to what the majority of people believe. The book includes a recommended resource list, Endnotes for each chapter 1-18 with a final word, short author biographies and related book lists.",

Reluctant to remain in Hungary until either the Nazis or the Soviets took over, he fled at the age of 23 with a forged exit visa and fifty pounds sterling to stave off hunger in Istanbul, Turkey. During his off hours as a dancer, he read some 200 books on the market and the great speculators, spending as much as eight hours a day studying.Darvas ploughed his money into a couple of stocks that had been hitting their 52-week high. He was utterly surprised that the stocks continued to rise and subsequently sold them to make a large profit. His main source of stock selection was Barron's Magazine. At the age of 39, after accumulating his fortune, Darvas documented his techniques in the book, How I Made 2,000,000 in the Stock Market. The book describes his unique \"Box System,\" which he used to buy and sell stocks. Darvas' book remains a classic stock market text to this day.",

STP toppled such megabands as Aerosmith and Guns N\u2019 Roses on MTV and the Billboard charts. Lead singer Scott Weiland became an iconic front man in the tradition of Mick Jagger, David Bowie, and Robert Plant. Then, when STP imploded, it was Weiland who emerged as the emblem of rock star excess, with his well-publicized drug busts and trips to rehab.Weiland has since made a series of stunning comebacks, fronting the supergroup Velvet Revolver, releasing solo work, and reuniting with Stone Temple Pilots. He has prevailed as a loving, dedicated father, as well as a business-savvy artist whose well of creativity is far from empty. Not Dead & Not for Sale is a hard rock memoir to be reckoned with\u2014a passionate, insightful, and at times humorous book that reads with extraordinary narrative force.",

        "description": "In this tale I introduce you to Puryas, the schemer for wealth at any cost but fated to find his efforts as elusive as water in the Waste. He inhabits a world where successive Empires have risen and fallen for eons. History has faded into myth, wizardry has almost been reduced to science, and governing is really about raw power and control. But it\u2019s also about the physical reality of this world: A climate that fluctuates from extreme heat to bitter cold, a massive wall that wards off the rising sea without and competing barbarian hordes that see the old cities as a source of wealth and plunder. A potent mix that I think will make for interesting reading. As time goes on you\u2019ll find more and more back matter and details on the website www.talesofthewaste.com . Enjoy this novel and, if it intrigues you, the rest in the series. Comments are welcome, and criticism taken with a grain of salt\u2026. In many ways this novel, as well as the other four in the series, are a return to my first writing roots. I grew up on a reading diet of epic sword-and-sorcery; the tales of Howard, Tolkien and Vance were as formative as my studies in history. As a result, my first four novels were set in such a world in the fantasy genre. The genre has evolved. Now it is routine to see TV and movies, graphic novels and video games, all produced on related epic themes. This, the second novel in my new series, is my attempt to improve on my first efforts 40 years ago. It combines the best of Tolkien\u2014history, maps, language, glossaries and interesting tales\u2014with a variety of writing styles and viewpoints. I\u2019ve learned a lot in my writing career, this is the result.",

In line, everything that hangs on the present consumeristic approach to Christendom will and must morph.The Gospel came to us through fully paid, barely paid, and mostly non-paid saints.

Tonight, he will be with his Polish mistress; tomorrow, at a workers' bar in the city's factory district, he will meet with the military attach\u00e9 from the French embassy. Information will be exchanged for money. So begins THE SPIES OF WARSAW, with war coming to Europe, and French and German operatives locked in a life-and-death struggle on the espionage battlefield. At the French embassy, the new military attach\u00e9, Colonel Jean-Francois Mercier, a decorated hero of the 1914 war, is drawn in to a world of abduction, betrayal and intrigue in the diplomatic salons and back alleys of Warsaw. At the same time, the handsome aristocrat finds himself in a passionate love affair with a Parisian woman of Polish heritage, a lawyer for the League of Nations. Colonel Mercier must work in the shadows, amidst an extraordinary cast of venal and dangerous characters - Colonel Anton Vyborg of Polish military intelligence, last seen in Furst's THE POLISH OFFICER; the mysterious and sophisticated Doctor Lapp, senior German Abwehr officer in Warsaw; Malka and Viktor Rozen, at work for the Russian secret service; and Mercier's brutal and vindictive opponent, Major August Voss of SS counterintelligence. And there are many more, some known to Mercier as spies, some never to be revealed.",

Tutti scavavano: pochi facevano fortuna, molti morivano. Qualcuno diventava uomo, come Ralph Ballantyne, tra le braccia mercenarie della bella Lil; altri come Jordan, lui pure figlio di Zouga Ballantyne, s'accingevano a prendere strade differenti che non ne avrebbero fatto davvero dei campioni di virilit\u00e0, pur rendendoli potenti sotto altri punti di vista, magari grazie all'amicizia affettuosa di un Cecil Rhodes...

        "description": "Numa confeitaria de Budapeste, Ilonka conta a uma amiga a hist\u00f3ria de seu casamento desfeito, e relembra a inutilidade do esfor\u00e7o para conquistar a alma do ex-marido, encantado desde a juventude por Judit, uma simples criada. Depois, na atmosfera carregada de um caf\u00e9, P\u00e9ter, o ex-marido de Ilonka, narra a um amigo a sua vers\u00e3o sobre a separa\u00e7\u00e3o. Trinta anos mais tarde, na cama de um quarto de hotel em Roma, Judit fala ao novo namorado, m\u00fasico, sobre a uni\u00e3o fracassada com P\u00e9ter, condenada de in\u00edcio pelo abismo existente entre seu ressentimento indissol\u00favel e as amarras impostas a seu parceiro, nobre por heran\u00e7a e filia\u00e7\u00e3o. Finalmente, em Nova York, o baterista de cabar\u00e9, o \u00faltimo confidente de Judit, faz uma cr\u00edtica \u00e1spera da ditadura da sociedade de consumo, respons\u00e1vel pelo fim do sonho americano. Escrito ao longo de quatro d\u00e9cadas, e na voz de quatro narradores, 'De verdade' disseca os conflitos do amor e do casamento, al\u00e9m de revelar os bastidores da burguesia decadente da Europa Central entre as duas grandes guerras. Demarcando com agudeza a fronteira intranspon\u00edvel que separa as classes sociais, o romance reabre as cicatrizes de uma capital agonizante, sitiada pelas tropas comunistas.",

        "description": "Twenty-something Australian Brooke Reynolds works as commissioning editor for Sydney-based popular fiction publishers Horizon books. One morning, she stumbles across a manuscript submission from a would-be author entitled \"The Last to Know\", a contemporary story about the interconnecting lives and loves of three women based in Dublin. At first, the novel reads like a feel-good, light-hearted tale about life, friendship and the problems modern women face; exactly the kind of book Horizon usually publish. But when Brooke tries to contact the author with a view to offering her a publishing deal, she proves strangely difficult to locate. And as Brooke becomes more and more absorbed in the manuscript, she gradually realises that there is a lot more to this story than meets the eye. Who is the elusive author of \"The Last to Know\", and what story is she really telling",

        "description": "At the Pilgrim's first Thanksgiving in 1621, chief among the honored guests was Massasoit, the sachem of the Wampanoag. Half a century later, Massasoit's son, King Philip, had been shot at the end of a bloody two-year conflict. The war began as a skirmish between the Wampanoag and the English on the frontier of Plymouth colony and ended with many of the New England's settlements reduced to ashes.As many as 800 colonists were killed, but the Native Americans suffered even greater losses in their pivotal struggle against the colonists. Devastated by disease and famine, the native peoples of southern New England were violently removed from their ancestral homelands. Three hundred years later, their fight for justice has been all but erased from the history books.At once an in-depth history of this pivotal war and a guide to the historical sites where the ambushes, raids, and battles took place,King Philip's Warexpands our understanding of American history and provides insight into the nature of colonial and ethnic wars in general.Through a careful reconstruction of events, first-person accounts, period illustrations, and maps, and by providing information on the exact locations of more than fifty battles,King Philip's Waris useful as well as informative.Students of history, colonial war buffs, those interested in Native American history, and anyone who is curious about how this war affected a particular New England town, will find important insights into one of the most seminal events to shape the American mind and continent.",

        "description": "The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be devastating. It\u2019s important to note, though, that while COPD is debilitating, it is not a death sentence. With proper disease management, people with COPD can expect to live a full and happy life. While there are no magic pills or quick fixes, there are many things COPD sufferers can do to have more energy, less shortness of breath, and an overall better quality of life despite breathlessness or use of home oxygen. This comprehensive guide helps people in any stage of COPD learn to work with their physical limitations rather than against them. Compassionate and clearly written, it covers every aspect of the disease, including the psychological and emotional issues that go along with having COPD, medications and physical therapy, identifying triggers and warning signs, creating an action plan for worsening symptoms, techniques to make breathing easier, working with healthcare providers, and much more.",

But Cinnamon doesn't mind it too much, because even though she gets stuck on some bad things, she also gets stuck on many good things. Soon, Cinnamon realizes that the OCD is a part of her, and it is part of what makes her special!",

        "description": "Jessica Mitford was a member of one of England\u2019s most legendary families (among her sisters were the novelist Nancy Mitford and the current Duchess of Devonshire) and one of the great muckraking journalists of modern times. Leaving England for America, she pursued a career as an investigative reporter and unrepentant gadfly, publicizing not only the misdeeds of, most famously, the funeral business (The American Way of Death, a bestseller) and the prison business (Kind and Usual Punishment), but also of writing schools and weight-loss programs. Mitford\u2019s diligence, unfailing skepticism, and acid pen made her one of the great chroniclers of the mischief people get up to in the pursuit of profit and the name of good.Poison Penmanshipcollects seventeen of Mitford\u2019s finest pieces\u2014about everything from crummy spas to network-TV\u00a0censorship\u2014and fills them out with the story of how she got the scoop and, no less fascinating, how the story developed after publication. The book is a delight to read: few journalists have ever been as funny as Mitford, or as gifted at getting around in those dark, cobwebbed corners where modern America fashions its shiny promises. It\u2019s also an unequaled and necessary manual of the fine art of investigative reporting.",

        "description": "Writer and journalist Giles Milton specializes in the history of travel and exploration. His latest literary adventure,White Gold, is the story of Thomas Pellow, a Cornish cabin boy who was captured at sea by a group of fanatical Islamic slave traders\u0097the Barbary corsairs, taken in chains to the great slave markets of Algiers, Tunis and Sal\u00e8 in Morocco and sold to the highest bidder. Pellow's purchaser happened to be the tyrannical sultan of Morroco, Moulay Ismail, a man committed to building a vast imperial pleasure palace of unsurpassable splendour built entirely by Christian slave labour. After enduring long periods of torture Pellow converted to Islam and became the personal slave of the sultan for over two decades\u0097including a stint as a soldier in the sultan's army\u0097before finally making a dramatic escape and return to Cornwall. The account is supported by the unpublished letters and manuscripts of slaves and the various ambassadors sent to free them. This is an excellently written account of the history of the white slave trade. Pellow's story is an extraordinary one but the real interest lies in the picture Milton builds of life in the slave pens and especially of daily life at the court of the spectacularly barbaric Moulay Ismail. --Larry Brown",

Readers are invited to delight in the sounds and semantics of letters A-Z, discovering many quirks of the English language along the way. This is no simple reading primer - it's a celebration of the absurdities of spelling and pronunciation, using ingenious puns and idioms, old and new. The stylish letterform illustrations by Riccardo Guasco beautifully amplify the humour and occasional pathos of Jonathan Hope's playful verse. A gem of a book for all phonetics-phobic adults, linguistically-curious children and fun-seeking English language learners and teachers.",

        "description": "Acutely aware of the changes affecting English at the end of the Victorian era, writer and journalist J. Redding Ware set out to record words and turns of phrase from all walks of life, from the curses in common use by sailors to the rhyming slang of the street and the jargon of the theater dandies. In doing so, he extended the lifespan of words like \u201cair-hole,\u201d \u201clally-gagging,\u201d and \u201cbow-wow mutton.\u201dFirst published in 1909 and reproduced here with a new introduction by Oxford English Dictionary former editor John Simpson, The Victorian Dictionary of Slang and Phrase 1909 reflects the rich history of unofficial English. Many of the expressions are obsolete; one is not likely to have the misfortune of encountering a \u201cparlour jumper.\u201d Order a \u201cshant of bivvy\u201d at the pub and you\u2019ll be met with a blank stare. But some of the entries reveal the origins of expressions still in use today, such as calling someone a \u201cbad egg\u201d to indicate that they are dishonest or of ill-repute. While showing the significant influence of American English on Victorian slang, the Dictionary also demonstrates how impressively innovative its speakers were. A treasure trove of everyday language of the nineteenth century, this book has much to offer in terms of insight into the intriguing history of English and will be of interest to anyone with a passion for words.",

        "description": "In this astonishingly accomplished, morally complicated, \u201cexceptional and starkly beautiful debut\u201d (Kevin Powers, National Book Award\u2013nominated author ofThe Yellow Birds), a prideful electrician in 1920s rural Alabama struggles to overcome past sins and find peace after being sent to prison for manslaughter.Roscoe T Martin set his sights on a new type of power spreading at the start of the twentieth century: electricity. It became his training, his life\u2019s work. But when his wife, Marie, inherits her father\u2019s failing farm, Roscoe has to give up his livelihood, with great cost to his sense of self, his marriage, and his family. Realizing he might lose them all if he doesn\u2019t do something, he begins to use his skills as an electrician to siphon energy from the state, ushering in a period of bounty and happiness. Even the love of Marie and their child seem back within Roscoe\u2019s grasp.Then a young man working for the state power company stumbles on Roscoe\u2019s illegal lines and is electrocuted, and everything changes: Roscoe is arrested; the farm once more starts to deteriorate; and Marie abandons her husband, leaving him to face his twenty-year sentence alone. Now an unmoored Roscoe must carve out a place at Kilby Prison. Climbing the ranks of the incarcerated from dairy hand to librarian to \u201cdog boy,\u201d an inmate who helps the guards track down escapees, he is ultimately forced to ask himself once more if his work is just that, or if the price of his crimes\u2014for him and his family\u2014is greater than he ever let himself believe.Gorgeously spare and brilliantly insightful,Work Like Any Otheris \u201ca striking debut about love and redemption, the heavy burdens of family and guilt, and learning how to escape them\u2026Virginia Reeves is a major new talent\u201d (Philipp Meyer,New York Timesbestselling author ofThe Son).",

        "description": "In 1927, while a student of architecture at the Moscow Vhutemas, Georgii Krutikov presented a vision for a flying city. More than just a flight of architectural fancy, Krutikov\u2019s flying city was a utopian dream, a plan to solve the seemingly intractable problems of overcrowding and resource depletion by moving humanity\u2019s living quarters to space. Inspired in equal parts by sci-fi dreams of space travel and the revolutionary idealism that still percolated in the Soviet Union at that time, Krutikov created an incredible amount of detailed information about his sketches, drawings, plans, and more.Krutikov\u2019s flying city has been cited as a major influence on Russian modernism for decades, yet little has been written about the design, its creator, or his subsequent architectural career. This beautifully illustrated book fills that gap, presenting a detailed study of Krutikov\u2019s scheme and its underlying ethos, then tracing Krutikov\u2019s later work as an architect. It will interest\u2014and amaze\u2014all fans of the avant-garde, architecture, and Russian history.",

        "description": "Hesiod describes himself as a Boeotian shepherd who heard the Muses call upon him to sing about the gods. His exact dates are unknown, but he has often been considered a younger contemporary of Homer. This volume of the new Loeb Classical Library edition offers a general introduction, a fluid translation facing an improved Greek text of Hesiod's two extant poems, and a generous selection of testimonia from a wide variety of ancient sources regarding Hesiod's life, works, and reception.In \"Theogony\" Hesiod charts the history of the divine world, narrating the origin of the universe and the rise of the gods, from first beginnings to the triumph of Zeus, and reporting on the progeny of Zeus and of goddesses in union with mortal men. In \"Works and Days\" Hesiod shifts his attention to the world of men, delivering moral precepts and practical advice regarding agriculture, navigation, and many other matters; along the way he gives us the myths of Pandora and of the Golden, Silver, and other Races of Men.",

        "description": "For centuries, historians have speculated that the Queen of Sheba is nothing more than a seductive legend; but when undercover agent Omar Zagouri finds a tomb in a tunnel beneath Jerusalem, he unearths cryptic clues that may lead to the queen\u2019s final resting place. This discovery, if authentic, could throw into question the governmental claim to the Holy Land\u2015and prove the Bible false. Wealthy collectors, ruthless archaeologists, and officials from Egypt, Ethiopia, Israel, and Yemen scramble to find and lay claim to the secret site. Dr. Richard Lyon of Brown University, the world\u2019s leading expert on the queen, is found murdered in his office, setting off a chain of deadly events. Omar desperately works to piece together the puzzle to locate the queen\u2019s burial ground, fearing another assassination will take place. He teams up with one of Lyon\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9es as well as with his ex-girlfriend, agent Mia Golding, in order to unravel the truth about the queen, expose a murderer, and reveal a timeless story of love, revenge, and sacrifice.

Il est \u00e9crit dans le style indirect qu'ils affectionnent : l\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous proc\u00e9derions par d\u00e9finitions et d\u00e9ductions, ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent l'allusion et l'incitation.Fran\u00e7ois Jullien, en publiant et commentant cette traduction, nous permet d\u2019entrevoir la philosophie chinoise et ses rapports avec notre propre philosophie.

Now they've been thrown together in a last-ditch effort to save the family coffeehouse business before it goes permanently down the drain.In the chaotic misdt of mad promotional schemes and piranhalike next-door competitors, the sisters Greenfield are going to have to put aside their hard-faught sibling rivalry -- and quick! -- for the family good.What happens when a single woman in her early thirties gets stuck living and working with her sister again along with all the insecurities of sibling rivalry?\"From where I stood now, fifteen years out of high school, I knew that smart was more valuable than pretty. For one thing, pretty is available to anyone who has the time, energy, money, and will. And even without exercise or makeup, I considered myself to be serviceably attractive. I elicit a grunt from workmen. Baggers at the supermarket, however, called me ma'am.\"Meet Francesca Greenfield, a smart, urban professional suddenly tossed out of her so-so career and into the business of selling coffee alongside her pretty, perky sister Amanda.But selling coffee is only the start of their worries.Francesca has always known that she was the smart sister, \"though our mother never set us down and said, 'Francesca, we'll call you the smart one.'\" Amanda was soft and lovely from the beginning and had always garnered most of the attention-and all of the dates. Now they've been thrown together in a last-ditch effort to save the family business before it goes permanently down the drain.As for the coffeehouse itself, well, there's rarely a dull moment. Consider the piranha-minded next-door franchise and the brainstorms of one nearly psychotic marketing manager for starters. And who can forget about love? Or at least sex. Thanks to a promotional contest, it's not long before Amanda is looking to explore the aura of a buff mountain climber while Francesca considers shedding more than her inhibitions with a J. Crew model.The stakes are rising. It's time to find out if smart or pretty knows best, whether the distinction really suits either one of them, and if the Greenfield sisters can actually live happily ever after.",

        "description": "\"One of the most important openings in the path to the modern computer was made by the British mathematician Alan Turing - remarkably, while he was solving an entirely different problem. Shy and insecure about his middle-class origins, considered eccentric by those who did not know him well, Turing could show those close to him sly humor and bracing candor - even about his homosexuality. He also had one of the keenest minds of the twentieth century.\" \"Turing's famous 1936 doctoral dissertation tackled one of the great mathematical challenges of the time, the \"decidability problem,\" by proposing and imaginary programmable calculating machine. The idea of actually producing such a \"Turing machine\" did not crystallize until Turing and his brilliant Bletchley Park colleagues built devices to crack the Nazis' Enigma code, thus ensuring the Allies' victory in World War II. Along the way, Turing crossed paths with some of the greatest minds of his time, including John von Neumann and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\" \"After the war, Turing became a champion of artificial intelligence, formulating the famous Turing Test that challenges our ideas of human consciousness. But Turing's postwar computer-building was cut short when he was arrested for violating antihomosexuality laws and sentenced to a \"treatment\" that amounted to chemical castration.\" As he explains Turing's work and its implications, David Leavitt never loses sight of Turing's humanity, using a novelist's sensitivity to enter Turing's world and tell his extraordinary story.",

As you should know by now, he is a political prisoner in Panama. . ..Born in the United States and raised in Panama, Kurt Muse grew up with a deep love for his adopted country. But the crushing regime of General Manuel Noriega in the late 1980s threatened his, and a nation's, freedom.

        "description": "Vacuum Flowers is a sf novel by Michael Swanwick, published in 1987. It's an early example of cyberpunk, featuring one of the earliest uses of the concept wetware. The protagonist is Rebel Elizabeth Mudlark, the recorded personality of a dead woman which has become the property of a corporation that intends to sell it as entertainment. Rebel escapes by taking over the body of Eucrasia Walsh, a woman who rents herself out for temporary testing of new wetware programming. While escaping the corporation Eucrasia's latent personality begins to reassert itself. Rebel's adventures take her throughout the widely-colonised solar system. She initially lives in canister worlds orbiting the Sun in a trojan orbit, where she sometimes works removing bioengineered weeds (vacuum flowers, a space-tolerant flora) from exterior ports. Since the recording omits most of her memories, she must rely on strangers to help her survive, tho she cannot trust them. Rebel meets & falls in love with Wyeth, a leader whose personality was reprogrammed into a team of four complementary personas. Together they form an uneasy alliance with The Comprise, the hive mind which rules Earth, & encounter Dysonworlders, who live on genetically engineered artificial comets.",

As he visits his senile mother in a nursing home, he secretly muses on how, when, and where to put himself out of his misery.To prevent his only daughter from discovering his body, Jonas decides it's best to die abroad. Armed with little more than his toolbox and a change of clothes, he flies to an unnamed country where the fumes of war still hover in the air.

        "description": "This first full-length study of women and the Fatimids is a groundbreaking work investigating an unexplored area in the field of Islamic and medieval studies.The authors have unearthed a wealth of references to women, thus re-inscribing their role in the history of one of the most fascinating Islamic dynasties, the only one to be named after a woman. At last some light is thrown on the erstwhile silent and shadowy figures of women under the Fatimids which gives them a presence in the history of women in medieval and pre-modern dynasties.Basing their research on a variety of sources from historical works to chronicles, official correspondence, documentary sources and archaeological findings, the authors have provided a richly informative analysis of the status and influence of women in this period. Their contribution is explored first within the context of Isma\u2018ili and Fatimid genealogical history, and then within the courts in their roles as mothers, courtesans, wives and daughters, and as workers and servants. Throughout the book comparison is drawn with the status and roles of women in earlier, contemporary and subsequent Islamic as well as non-Islamic courts.",

There are some who believe that technology's future development should be controlled, and that it may already have gone too far, especially in areas such as the use of energy - something which has the potential to permanently harm our environment.

It centers around a young Nigerian woman, Ada, who develops separate selves within her as a result of being born \"with one foot on the other side.\" Unsettling, heartwrenching, dark, and powerful,Freshwateris a sharp evocation of a rare way of experiencing the world, one that illuminates how we all construct our identities.Ada begins her life in the south of Nigeria as a troubled baby and a source of deep concern to her family. Her parents, Saul and Saachi, successfully prayed her into existence, but as she grows into a volatile and splintered child, it becomes clear that something went terribly awry. When Ada comes of age and moves to America for college, the group of selves within her grows in power and agency. A traumatic assault leads to a crystallization of her alternate selves: As\u1ee5ghara and Saint Vincent. As Ada fades into the background of her own mind and these selves--now protective, now hedonistic--move into control, Ada's life spirals in a dark and dangerous direction.Narrated by the various selves within Ada and based in the author's realities,Freshwaterdazzles with ferocious energy and serpentine grace, heralding the arrival of a fierce new literary voice.",

        "description": "Richard English's brilliant new book, now available in paperback, is a compelling narrative history of Irish nationalism, in which events are not merely recounted but analysed. Full of rich detail, drawn from years of original research and also from the extensive specialist literature on the subject, it offers explanations of why Irish nationalists have believed and acted as they have, why their ideas and strategies have changed over time, and what effect Irish nationalism has had in shaping modern Ireland. It takes us from the Ulster Plantation to Home Rule, from the Famine of 1847 to the Hunger Strikes of the 1970s, from Parnell to Pearse, from Wolfe Tone to Gerry Adams, from the bitter struggle of the Civil War to the uneasy peace of the early twenty-first century. Is it imaginable that Ireland might \u2013 as some have suggested \u2013 be about to enter a post-nationalist period? Or will Irish nationalism remain a defining force on the island in future years? 'a courageous and successful attempt to synthesise the entire story between two covers for the neophyte and for the exhausted specialist alike' Tom Garvin, Irish Times",

        "description": "The tales of ancient Egypt have for centuries delighted and spurred the imagination of anyone who loves a good story, yet sadly, many of these tales have fallen into obscurity over the years. Now these stories have been brought back to life for a new generation of readers. When first published in 1882, the folktales collected in Popular Stories of Ancient Egypt comprised the first anthology of ancient Egyptian narratives ever to be compiled into book form. The culmination of a life's work by Gaston Maspero, a towering figure of nineteenth-century Egyptology, it presented a wealth of information on Egyptian culture, language, history, and society. Since its publication, additional texts have been discovered, deciphered, or translated into modern languages. The present collection is made up of twenty-four tales gleaned from countless ancient written sources, and from a variety of historical periods. It contains some of the most ancient folktales in existence, such as The Tale of the Two Brothers, thought to be the oldest in the world. Other stories include King Khufui and the Magicians, The Lamentations of the Fellah, The Shipwrecked Sailor, The Adventure of Satni-Khamois with the Mummies, The Doomed Prince, and The Story of Rhampsinitus. This edition contains a new Foreword that introduces Maspero and describes his work, and provides for the first time extensive identifications of the ancient stories in terms of international tale-types and motifs. Certain to be of interest to folklorists, this classic collection will also amuse parents, students, storytellers, and anyone who enjoys authentic folk wisdom.",

        "description": "Working with thousands of previously unreleased documents and drawing on more than one thousand interviews, with many witnesses speaking out for the first time, Joan Mellen revisits the investigation of New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, the only public official to have indicted, in 1969, a suspect in President John F. Kennedy\u2019s murder.Garrison began by exposing the contradictions in the Warren Report, which concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was an unstable pro-Castro Marxist who acted alone in killing Kennedy. A Farewell to Justice reveals that Oswald, no Marxist, was in fact working with both the FBI and the CIA, as well as with U.S. Customs, and that the attempts to sabotage Garrison\u2019s investigation reached the highest levels of the U.S. government. Garrison interviewed various individuals involved in the assassination, ranging from Clay Shaw and CIA contract employee David Ferrie to a Marine cohort of Oswald named Kerry Thornley, who at the very least was a Defense Intelligence Agency asset. Garrison\u2019s suspects included CIA-sponsored soldiers of fortune enlisted in assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, an anti-Castro Cuban asset, and a young runner for the conspirators, interviewed here for the first time by the author.Building upon Garrison\u2019s effort, Mellen uncovers decisive new evidence and clearly establishes the intelligence agencies\u2019 roles in both a president\u2019s assassination and its cover-up, set in motion well before the actual events of November 22, 1963.",

There was no way Zelde was going to stand for that, and when the ship's first officer, Parnell, led an anti-UET revolt, Zelde joined the mutineers and single-handedly turned defeat into victory.First as Parnell's lover, then as his assistant, Zelde was mistrusted by the crew,but when the UET struck again and Parnell died, there was only one choice for captain: Zelde M'Tana.Zelde M'Tana is a main character in the Rissa Kerguelen Bran Tregare series. This book delves into her childhood, adolescence and early adulthood giving you an even greater appreciation of Zelde. While it is technically a prequel to the main series, it can be read at any point the reader wants insight into this character without over powering the storyline of the Rissa saga.",

        "description": "Voted Best Business Book in 2014! by Pacific Book Review Loopholes of Real Estate clearly reveals the tax and legal loopholes you need to know to be a successful real estate investor. Knowledge is power; this book is a must read for the strategic investor. - Geraldine Barry, President SJREI Association & Publisher of REI Voice Magazine There is no time like the present to take steps towards a successful real estate investing venture especially with using this book as your guide. Written by Garrett Sutton who is an acclaimed author, lawyer and advisor to the well-known and well-received, Rich Dad Poor Dad series of financial self help books. Mr. Sutton has also authored numerous other books on Financial/Business self help, therefore the reader can rest assured that the information contained in this book is reliable because it is coming from an expert source and is not offering vague advice on a \"get-rich-quick scheme.\" Loopholes of Real Estate is an updated version of previously published edition(s). The book is divided into five parts each section relevant to the varied aspects of successful real estate investing and the loopholes that protect the resulting assets. Part One - Real Estate Advantages contains the background information (theories and facts) on real estate investing and its benefits. Part Two - Get in the Game advises readers on how to devise an investment plan, gather your personal advisement team, and decide on your investment. Part Three - Tax Strategies - demonstrates how to analyze the financial potential of possible investments, looks at tax advantages and managing your investments. Part Four- Legal Strategies illustrates various legal methods for protecting your investments. Part five - Selection Strategies informs readers of legal and other issues pertinent to choosing a potentially profitable property. Found at the end of every chapter, are sections that detail the viable loopholes related to the information included in the chapter. Also contained in the book are multiple, relevant checklists, referrals to other informative resources (online) and books written by other experts in the real estate field. Being that I am neither a real estate Investor nor someone who has a working knowledge of such things, I expected this book to be boring and doused in confusing lingo but instead I was pleasantly surprised. Written in a friendly tone and worded so that it is easy to understand, this is a precisely written, thoroughly organized guide to all things real estate; it does not just inundate the reader with laws, tax rules, and loopholes it offers lucid explanations demonstrated by case examples that depict real life situations. Additionally, this is not just a book for those looking to attain wealth through real estate investing it also serves as an intensely informative resource for business owners, married couples, business partners, and particularly homeowners, especially chapters 25 (Protecting Your Home and Related Asset Protection Strategies), 29 (Duties Owed by Real Estate brokers and Agents), and 30 (Legal Due Diligence). This is an excellent book for those looking to invest in real estate - the information contained in this book does well to clarify the do's, don'ts and loopholes and I heartily recommend this book as a must read for anyone interested in real estate on any level. Whether you're buying your first home, or adding another multi-unit apartment complex to your vast real estate portfolio, Garrett Sutton's book is a fantastic overview of the \"nuts and bolts\" of buying, owning and selling real estate. - Pacific Book Review ...Sutton ( Run Your Own Corporation , 2012, etc.), an attorney, expert in business law and one of ... Robert T. Kiyosaki's stable of Rich Dad Advisors, offers clever, if complicated, new ploys to grow",

In this wildly seductive romp through the lush canyons and lavish neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the line between business and pleasure quickly blurs in a dizzying rush of sex and celebrity. Just as our heroine\u2019s uncanny genius for matching up her growing roster of exclusive love seekers continues to deepen, her own love life reaches a fever pitch. Things get complicated. And funny. And excruciatingly sensual. Cynthia\u2019s high-maintenance lovelorn mother, her maddeningly hot ex-fling Max, a long-lost high school crush, and of course her best friend, the libidinous, star-crazed Lolita and her mysterious pack of telepathic canines, are all along for the ride. Not to mention one very rich, very famous film producer. On top of everything else, her newest, most important client is literally the biggest movie star in the world. In more ways than one. When it comes to extra curriculars, he is the hardest-working stud in show business. Try as Cynthia may to hook him up with any number of gorgeous ladies in waiting, his notoriously one-track mind is set on her. She\u2019s determined to steer the dating service to the next level, but it\u2019s hard to focus, let alone keep your hands on the wheel, when you\u2019re hot, bothered, and nearly driven to distraction along the steamy highways and byways of love and lust.

        "description": "Commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of Elvis\u2019s death, an intimate memoir of a friendship with the greatest artist in rock and roll history, taking you from late-night parties at Graceland to the bright lights of Hollywood sets and glittering stages of Vegas.On a lazy Sunday in 1954, twelve-year-old Jerry Schilling wandered into a Memphis touch football game, only to discover that his team was quarterbacked by a nineteen-year-old Elvis Presley, the local teenager whose first record, \"That\u2019s All Right,\" had just received its first play on Memphis radio. The two became fast friends, even as Elvis turned into the world\u2019s biggest star. In 1964, Elvis invited Jerry to work for him as part of his \"Memphis Mafia,\" and Jerry soon found himself living with Elvis full-time in a Bel Air mansion and, later, in his own room at Graceland. Over the next thirteen years Jerry would work for Elvis in various capacities\u2014from bodyguard to photo double to co-executive producer on a karate film.Me and a Guy Named Elvis looks at Presley from a friend\u2019s perspective, offering readers the man rather than the icon. Spanning Elvis\u2019s meteoric rise to those later troubled years, Jerry\u2019s story offers never-before-told stories about life inside Elvis\u2019s inner circle, and an insightful, emotional recounting of the great times, hard times, and unique times he and Elvis shared. Schilling\u2019s vivid memories will be priceless to Elvis\u2019s millions of fans, and his compelling life story will be fascinating to an even wider audience.",

Even if there wasn't, he\u2019d protect Maya regardless. Standing in the chief\u2019s office that morning, one look at her big blue eyes, wet with tears, and he was gone. When county arson investigator Liam Cohen confirms his suspicions, he\u2019s determined to help Maya prove her case. But the truth they uncover just leads to more secrets, ones someone will kill to protect.Trial by Fire is book 4 in the Southern Heat series, and can be read stand-alone.

        "description": "[Hardcover book-jacket description.]Anyone can learn to speak and write with humor. In this book, the reader can discover sure ways to develop humor for use in speeches, letters and conversation. Here Percy H. Whiting shows not only how to create witticisms but also how to deliver them\u2014and in a way that will always produce laughter. He asks only that the reader makes serious effort to acquire humor (and reminds us that even born humorists like Fred Allen and Will Rodgers sometimes worked terribly hard at being funny).Mr. Whiting begins by showing how he himself developed the ability to produce humor for his speeches\u2014and how others can use the same techniques. Humor, he says, is a discipline\u2014largely learned through a systematic study and use of \"humorous devices.\" With these devices\u2014exaggeration, anticlimax, understatement, pomposities, insults, mutilated quotations, over-ornate language are some of them\u2014Percy Whiting teaches you how to be funny. He gives explicit and tells exactly how to produce humor with these devices in particular speech situations.But humor is not what only what you do; it is what you must never do. Mr. Whiting spares no wrath on the clich\u00e9, and he puts slang and profanity under careful scrutiny. Sometimes the success of a humorous speech hangs on such a simple precaution as whether or not the banquet hall has been comfortably heated and well lighted. And the author advises the speaker to make sure beforehand that his P.A. system isn't noisy.Packed with much in common sense, experience, and expert know-how, How to Speak and Write with Humor can put sparkle and laughs into your speeches, conversations and letters.PERCY H. WHITING has successfully sold securities, has directed with notable results the Dale Carnegie Sales Courses, and has Written one of the most popular books of recent years on salesmanship, The 5 Great Rules of Selling.",

No premiado romance de Evie Wyld, a fazendeira Jake White leva uma vida simples numa ilha inglesa. Suas \u00fanicas companhias s\u00e3o rochedos, a chuva incessante, suas ovelhas e um cachorro, que atende pelo nome de C\u00e3o. Tendo escolhido a solid\u00e3o por vontade pr\u00f3pria, Jake precisa lidar com acontecimentos recentes que p\u00f5em em d\u00favida o quanto ela realmente est\u00e1 sozinha \u2013 e o quanto estar\u00e1 segura. De tempos em tempos, uma de suas ovelhas aparece morta, o que pode ser muito bem obra das raposas que habitam a floresta pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 sua fazenda. Ou de algo pior. Um menino perdido, um homem estranho, rumores sobre uma fera e fantasmas do seu pr\u00f3prio passado atormentam a vida de uma mulher que sonha com a reden\u00e7\u00e3o. Aos poucos, vamos descobrindo mais sobre as suas habilidades em tosquiar e cuidar de ovelhas, aprendidas ainda quando jovem, em sua terra natal, na Austr\u00e1lia. E vamos aprendendo tamb\u00e9m o que aconteceu l\u00e1, que acabou por conduzir White \u00e0 uma vida de reclus\u00e3o e isolamento. E sobre as contradi\u00e7\u00f5es e diferen\u00e7as entre um passado (sempre narrado no tempo verbal presente) cheio de vida e calor, e o presente (narrado por sua vez no passado) repleto de lama, frio e um ritmo mais desacelerado, paira uma atmosfera absolutamente brutal. Com uma prosa verdadeiramente excepcional, o estilo da autora re\u00fane tanto clareza como subst\u00e2ncia e apresenta uma personagem inesquec\u00edvel, enigm\u00e1tica, tr\u00e1gica, assombrada por um passado inescap\u00e1vel. Uma mulher forte, ainda que t\u00e3o pass\u00edvel de falhas, erros e equ\u00edvocos como todos n\u00f3s. \u00c9 uma hist\u00f3ria de solid\u00e3o e sobreviv\u00eancia, culpa, perda e o poder do perd\u00e3o. Uma escrita visceral onde sentimos a presen\u00e7a de tudo, os odores, o vento, o tempo. Nada passa desapercebido. Onde Cantam os P\u00e1ssaros \u00e9 o segundo romance de Evie Wyld \u2013 selecionada em 2013 pela revista Granta entre os melhores jovens escritores brit\u00e2nicos da d\u00e9cada \u2013 e mant\u00e9m uma pequena e simp\u00e1tica livraria independente no bairro de Peckham, em Londres. A Review Bookshop possui um pequeno jardim, \u00e9 dog friendly, realiza o Peckham Literary Festival e, claro, vende os melhores livros de grandes e pequenas editoras. Sua prosa refinada com altas doses de terror psicol\u00f3gico est\u00e1 muito bem representada na edi\u00e7\u00e3o que a DarkSide Books entrega a seus leitores em 2015. Ela queria se isolar de tudo e todos, mas agora est\u00e1 cercada pela crueldade do sil\u00eancio e a mais pura manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza. O ciclo da vida \u00e9 muito mais assustador quando o fim ecoa dentro de n\u00f3s. Prepare-se para descobrir uma grande autora, e um livro \u00e0 sua altura.",

Wesley Farrell, half-caste son of an Irish policeman, is no stranger to violence and death, but he's deeply affected when a bright young Federal agent is gunned down right in front of him. A few years later, a new act opens and Farrell, conscious of his debt to the dead man who had saved his life just before he died, elects to play a role. His investigation not only opens up some well kept secrets, it carries his own role with his father in new directions.... Atmospheric, faithful to its period, Robert Skinnet's fourth Wesley Farrell novel after Skin Deep Blood Red, Cat-Eyed Trouble, and Daddy's Gone a-Hunting is not just a suspenseful whodunit, but an exploration of family and of loss.",

To win this battle they will have to sell their souls. A mutilated body has been discovered; a body not meant to be found, but now that it has, Pandora\u2019s box is open and secrets never to be learned have been revealed. An Israeli woman living in New York has been murdered. She has been raped and butchered; an outrage that ignites a fuse that burns all the way back to Tel Aviv. Enter FBI Agent Chloe Mather, a hard-charging ex-Marine who has no sympathy for the kind of maggot who could commit such a violent atrocity. A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, she was one of the first woman Marines to be deployed into an active combat area. She struggles with PTSD and the consequences of a fatherless childhood, yet this is a woman who accepts no pity and operates according to a moral code that is second to none. She\u2019ll stop at nothing to find the psychopath responsible for this unspeakable crime. In Secrets of the Kill, Mather and this code will face the ultimate test. What begins as a challenging homicide becomes more, much more, and Mather is pulled into an investigation that involves the mob, Israeli intelligence, and a radical terrorist faction. They say that blood is thicker than water but is it thicker than the bonds of patriotism? Mather will ponder this question and many others as she fights to bring an innocent woman\u2019s murderer to justice, and prevent a geopolitical atrocity from taking place on American shores.",

        "description": "The University of Pittsburgh campus is anything but quiet the summer Jamie, a hunky college sophomore, feeling brokenhearted after being dumped by his first boyfriend, decides to audit a summer class on Egyptology taught by the magnetic Dr. Danilo. Several of the university\u2019s star athletes are then found murdered, their bodies completely desiccated, but Jamie has other things on his mind, as Danilo\u2019s attention turns decidedly nonprofessorial. Soon, he is swept up in a passionate affair with his teacher. When Danilo invites Jamie to travel with him, first to Paris and then to Egypt, the young man leaps at the chance, but in Paris, events turn sinister. At the Louvre, an exhibit of Egyptian artifacts includes a relief of a pharaoh kissing his son and successor, who bears more than a slight resemblance to Danilo. Taken alone, this means little, but a murder identical to those in Pittsburgh occurs, and Jamie begins to have uneasy suspicions. In Egypt, Jamie questions Danilo and learns of an ancient cult of kings connected by a single bloodline extending through centuries. Danilo is on a quest to invigorate this line of kings by initiating them and training them to use their power. Those who had been denied their birthright died so that Danilo might live. Now Jamie must choose whether to return to the world he has known, or to join his lover and mentor in a life of passion, power and blood. John Michael Curlovich has published Cities of the Dead , Owl Light , and The Colors of Hell under the pseudonym Michael Paine. He is the arts and entertainment editor at Planet Q in Pittsburgh.",

Add to the mix British loyalists quiet since the Revolutionary War, the short-lived Republic of West Texas, the 1812 War, the defeat of Napoleon and the New England States pushing for secession and you have an adventure that involves the intrigue of top-level politics of the day. Did I mention the duplicitous Governor of Georgia!",

        "description": "In 1815 a manuscript containing one of the long-lost treasures of antiquity was discovered\u2014the letters of Marcus Cornelius Fronto, reputed to have been one of the greatest Roman orators. But this find disappointed many nineteenth-century readers, who had hoped for the letters to convey all of the political drama of Cicero\u2019s. That the collection included passionate love letters between Fronto and the future emperor Marcus Aurelius was politely ignored\u2014or concealed. And for almost two hundred years these letters have lain hidden in plain sight.Marcus Aurelius in Loverescues these letters from obscurity and returns them to the public eye. The story of Marcus and Fronto began in 139 CE, when Fronto was selected to instruct Marcus in rhetoric. Marcus was eighteen then and by all appearances the pupil and teacher fell in love. Spanning the years in which the relationship flowered and died, these are the only love letters to survive from antiquity\u2014homoerotic or otherwise. With a translation that reproduces the effusive, slangy style of the young prince and the rhetorical flourishes of his master, the letters between Marcus and Fronto will rightfully be reconsidered as key documents in the study of the history of sexuality and classics.",

        "description": "Young Milford Spitz and Zoe May have no relatives. They desperately want to escape poor foster care treatment, so they run away and team up with the local bully, Bobby Mang, who is also escaping from his own horrible home life. But Bobby really means business when it comes to running away. You see, he has a very fast machine that can travel in space, through dimensions and in time. Bobby wasn\u2019t originally from Minnesota like Milford and his friend, Little Zoe May. The very fast machine (or VFM) takes them to adventures way beyond Milford\u2019s expectations. Bobby reveals how the machine came to be, and that his father and Professor Albert Einstein crafted the machine. As it turns out, Einstein wasn\u2019t actually from Earth \u2013 or from Bobby\u2019s world either.Throughout their journeys, Milford, Little Zoe May, and Bobby Mang discover an education that they could never get at the Winona Middle School back in Winona, Minnesota.",

        "description": "When love came knocking on the door of novice witch, Portia Mullins, in the form of handsome bad boy, Vance Mangum, she had no idea how quickly the attraction between them would escalate. Now she finds her relationship with Vance taken to a whole new level, in a way she had never dreamed possible at this point and time of her life. Yet even as the personal connection between them explodes, the two quickly find themselves in a world of shifting balances. While searching for Vance\u2019s missing mother, they realize they are suddenly unsure of who to trust, learning that sometimes things are not always as they appear. When Vance\u2019s demon characteristics abruptly begin to resurface again without warning, the horrible truth comes out, crashing down upon them and shattering some of their most precious dreams. Once the deadly plan is uncovered, Portia and Vance find themselves hastily rushing against the hands of time in an attempt to stop an ancient ritual from being performed. But will they be successful before fate reaches out to twist them cruelly, possibly separating them and changing magic forever? Passion, loyalties, powers, and family ties, will all be tested when dangerous adventures abound in this third installment in the Of Witches and Warlocks series, Blood of the White Witch.5 out of 5 Stars\"Each book keeps getting better and better, I didn't know it was even possible. I have never cried or shouted so much at a book in my life. This is one rollercoaster of a ride, full of ups and downs.\" Susan, Susan K Mann Reviews",

        "description": "Named in the University of Toronto Bookstore Review as one of the top100 Canadian books of all timeThere is much more than one good story in this bestselling (over 10,000 copies sold) collection of short fiction. In fact, there are more than a few of the best examples of native storytelling ever published. Thomas King, author of the acclaimedMedicine RiverandGreen Grass, Running Water, and the newly releasedTruth and Bright Water, has proven he has a magical gift, a fresh voice and a special brand of wit and comic imagination.One Good Story, That Oneis steeped in native oral tradition, led off by a sly creation tale, introducing the traditional native trickster coyote. Weaving the realities of native history and contemporary life through the story, King recounts a parodic version of the Garden of Eden story, slyly pulling our leg and our funnybone.A collection that is rich with strong characters, alive with crisp dialogue and shot through with the universal truths we are all searching for,One Good Story, That Oneis one great read.",

        "description": "The brilliant author ofFear Itselfpulls readers into an intricate web of ritual killings orchestrated by an evil pair of murderers who always manage to be one step ahead of the law.Former FBI Special Agent E.L. Pender may be retired, but he jumps at the chance to help solve a particularly gruesome series of crimes in the U.S. Virgin Islands.This is no ordinary case, seeing as the right hand on each body in the string of murders is missing. The police want to keep the existence of a serial killer under wraps; they hope to solve the crime before a stampede sets in. Meanwhile, Pender is convinced the killer must be the husband of the last victim and sets out to capture him -- but he's only partly right. The husband is connected to the case, but the real murderers are a cunning husband-and-wife team of archeologists who believe that if they breathe in their victim's last breath they will live forever.Never before has Pender come up against such savvy, diabolical opponents. From one trail of dead ends to another, readers will feel Pender's fever to prevent more murders from occurring...and his sheer panic when he can't.Twenty-Seven Bonesis that most quintessential of thrilling reads, providing a visceral experience of chills and excitement on every page.",

        "description": "\u201cThe vital questions which confront not only students of war but all concerned with peace and security are, why wars happen; how, if necessary, they should be fought; and above all how they can be prevented\u2026An understanding [of these issues] is impossible without some insight into the way in which societies have developed in the past and with them their cultures and their value systems.\u201d\u2015Michael Howard This important book by one of the most eminent military historians in the world discusses the processes of historical change that spawned the European wars of the twentieth century. In a series of elegantly written essays, Michael Howard ponders the continuing significance of nationalism and its relationship to the growth of industrial societies, modernization, and war. He explores the conflicting ideologies that arose from industrialism, tracing the development of new political organisms and attitudes as mass communications and universal education raised and transformed the level of political consciousness throughout the world. Howard argues that, although industrialization may tend to reduce belligerence by producing societies dedicated to material welfare rather than heroic achievement, organized violence remains a norm. In an introduction, he links these themes with the emergence of perestroika and glasnost in the Soviet sphere, with the difficulties experienced by Third World countries in creating viable political and economic communities, and with a Western bloc in which social tensions continue to increase.",

        "description": "If meditation were available in capsule form, it would be the biggest selling drug of all time. It has been scientifically proven to deliver highly effective stress relief, boost our immune systems, and dramatically slow the aging process. It has also been shown to make us much happier and more effective thinkers. Given all the physical and psychological benefits, why aren't more of us doing it? In this thought-provoking and entertaining book, David Michie explains the nuts and bolts of meditation. As a busy professional and a long-term meditator, he also gives a first-hand account of how to integrate this transformational practice into everyday life. Combining leading-edge science with timeless wisdom, Hurry Up and Meditate provides all the motivation and tools you need to achieve greater balance, better health, and develop a more panoramic perspective on life. The idea of infusing our daily schedule with newfound tranquility may sound appealing, but not everyone is temperamentally suited to sitting around in the lotus position chanting \"Om.\" Not to mention the fact that some of us just have very active minds. We'd like to meditate, but we're just not capable of switching off.\u00a0 The the amazing thing is that it's exactly the people who use the \"too busy,\" \"'too hard,\" and \"too hyper\" justifications who stand to gain the most from meditation.",

        "description": "Poetry. Native American Studies. Women's Studies. THE SKY WATCHED is a collection of poetry some bilingual that tells the collective story of a Minnesota Ojibwe family against the backdrop of history that begins with creation and continues to this day. Through poetry, Linda LeGarde Grover contributes to the continuation of Ojibwe worldview and survival in the recounting of history and family stories. In THE SKY WATCHED, the voices of children, adults and elders, of Indian boarding school students and traditional tribal storytellers, and of the Manidoog, the unseen beings who surround our lives every day are given voice in a manifestation of the Ojibwe oral tradition teachings on the written page. \"This is the first bilingual poetry book in English/Ojibwe. Not translations but poems using both languages. Linda LeGarde Grover's THE SKY WATCHED is a poetic reaction, in a wonderfully realistic voice, of spirit and essence of the Ojibwe people. Read it and be transformed, as readers of Beowulf and El Cid and other national epics have been throughout the ages.\" Geary Hobson \"THE SKY WATCHED bears witness to native experience. In Grover's work, time runs backwards through Ojibwe creation myths and explanation tales to find strength for the later years of boarding school and all the upheavals of the new world. Family plays a major role as does the roundness of moon, owl nest, gratitude, and the 'grace of this merciful earth.' There is heaven and hell in these heavenly poems.\" Diane Glancy \"Remember, remember, remember, Linda Grove's wonderful book demands. And she does. Again and again. Old tales from the Ojibwe tradition and new stories from mission schools and relocations where 'a tangle of children smell home in their dreams.' She captures the taste of recipes and the feel of beading bracelets alongside injustices minor as a navy bean and major as a lost language. These are poems as sad and essential as field of cotton flowers. You will remember them.\" Jeffrey Thompson, \"Linda LeGarde Grover tells of a calico flowered beanbag that when 'split it spilled the past, ' just as her poems spill extraordinary perceptions infused with Ojibwe spirituality along with haunting insight of raw boarding school memories that house a continent of pain and despair. THE SKY WATCHED is an intuitive voice of reverence that understands the power of the spirit.\" Denise Lajimodiere \"Linda Grover's THE SKY WATCHED is a beautiful litany of poems about Anishinaabe lives. She weaves English and Anishinaabemowin in lovely and innovative ways, and what is left at the end of the collection is a heartbreaking symphony full of many voices, all coming together with their own sorrowing but merciful hands. ''I hate when this happens, ' Richard says... spare(ing) us the sight of what was necessary, mercifully and quickly tightening the wire with his kind and sorrowing hands.\" Erika Wurth\"",

        "description": "Maen is a Gold Warrior, a defender of Aza City, a world controlled by the Queen and her womankind where the best of men are maintained for the military and the women's pleasure. A favorite of his imperious Mistress and a leader among his men, Maen is too cautious to seek casual sexual satisfaction and so stays alone, taking his comfort in ensuring a stable and controlled world.That world is thrown into disarray by Dax, a bold and challenging new Bronze soldier who excites Maen with his fierce hero worship and leads them to a forbidden affair. They find themselves thrown together in a dangerous and hostile environment without the support of the City and far away from their loyalties, and Maen finds himself risking everything for Dax - his position; his loyalties; and eventually, his life.NOTE: this book was withdrawn Oct 2010, and re-issued with its sequel Twisted Brand in the single volume BRANDED, also at Dreamspinner Press.",

        "description": "Eugenia Bone was perfectly happy with her life as a New York City food writer, but she knew that her husband, a transplanted westerner, was filled with a discontent he couldn't explain. So when he returned from a fishing trip in the Rockies one day and announced that he wanted to buy a forty-five-acre ranch in Crawford, Colorado (population 255), she reluctantly said yes. Then she loaded imported pasta, artichokes in oil, and cured Italian salami into her duffle bag and headed west with her two young children.At Mesa's Edge is the witty, often moving story of ranch restoration and of struggles with defiant skunks, barbed wire, marauding cows, and loneliness. Eugenia learns to garden in the drought, to fly-fish, and to forage. In the process, she discovers the bounty of the region. She fries zucchini flowers in batter and dips them in cilantro-flavored mayonnaise, grills flavorful T-bones from the local ranchers' grass-fed beef, pan-fries trout, fills crepes with wild mushrooms, and makes cherry pies with thick, sugary crusts. Gradually, she begins to adjust to the rhythms of the land.Partly a memoir, partly a cookbook with 150 appealing recipes, At Mesa's Edge is a transporting tale of rejuvenation, a celebration of everything local, and a reminder that the best food is to be found in our own back yards.",

        "description": "Orson Scott Card and Aaron Johnston return to their Ender's Game prequel series with this first volume of an all-new trilogy about the Second Formic War in The Swarm.The first invasion of Earth was beaten back by a coalition of corporate and international military forces and the Chinese army. China has been devastated by the Formic's initial efforts to eradicate Earth life forms and prepare the ground for their own settlement. The Scouring of China struck fear into the other nations of the planet; that fear blossomed into drastic action when scientists determined that the single ship that wreaked such damage was merely a scout ship. There is a mothership out beyond the solar system's Kuiper Belt, and it's heading into the system, unstoppable by any weapons that Earth can muster.Earth has been reorganized for defense. There is now a Hegemon, a planetary official responsible for keeping all the formerly warring nations in line. There's a Polemarch, responsible for organizing all the military forces of the planet into the new International Fleet. But there is an enemy within, an enemy as old as human warfare: ambition and politics. Greed and self-interest. Will Bingwen, Mazer Rackam, Victor Delgado, and Lem Juke be able to divert those very human enemies in time to create a weapon that can effectively defend humanity in the inexorable Second Formic War?Full cast of narrators includes Susan Hanfield, Emily Rankin, Orson Scott Card, and Aaron Johnston.",

        "description": "The disconnection between humans and nature is perhaps one of the most fundamental problems faced by our species today. The schism between us and the natural world is arguably the root cause of most of the environmental catastrophes unraveling around us. However, until we come to terms with the depths of our alienation, we will continue to fail to understand that what happens to nature also happens to us.InThe Biology of Wonderauthor Andreas Weber proposes a new approach to the biological sciences that puts the human back in nature. He argues that feelings and emotions, far from being superfluous to the study of organisms, are the very foundation of life. From this basic premise flows the development of a \"poetic ecology\" which intimately connects our species to everything that surrounds us\u2014showing that subjectivity and imagination are prerequisites of biological existence.The Biology of Wonderdemonstrates that there is no separation between us and the world we inhabit, and in so doing it validates the essence of our deep experience. By reconciling science with meaning, expression and emotion, this landmark work brings us to a crucial understanding of our place in the rich and diverse framework of life\u2014a revolution for biology as groundbreaking as the theory of relativity for physics.Dr. Andreas Weber is a German academic, scholar and author. He is a leader in the emerging fields of \"biopoetics\" and \"biosemiotics,\" and his work has been translated into several languages and published around the globe.",

The archway is tall because of the light which streams through it. Colour is only a distraction. By working in black and white the artist sees and renders to us the Divine light of her vision.",

And as ever, some murders receive more attention than others - especially those in which the victim is a prominent businessman found in his Park Avenue apartment tied to the bed - and strangled - with cords of black velvet.It doesn't surprise Lieutenant Eve Dallas that Thomas Anders' scandalous death is a source of titillation and speculation for the public - and humiliation for his family. While everyone else in the city is talking about it, those close to Anders aren't so anxious to do so. Fortunately, because Dallas' billionaire husband, Roarke, happens to own the prime real estate where Anders's sporting-goods firm was headquartered, she has some help with access.Before long, she's knocking on doors - or barging through them - to look for the answers she needs. But the facts don't add up. Physical evidence suggests that the victim didn't struggle. The security breach in the highly fortified apartment indicates that the killer was someone close to Anders, but everyone's alibi checks out, from the wife who was off in the tropics to the loving nephew who stands to inherit millions. Was this a crime of passion - or a carefully planned execution?It's up to Dallas to solve a sensational case where all involved guard secrets from one another - and strangers may be connected in unexpected and deadly ways.",

        "description": "Told with urgency and sharp political insight,Nixonlandrecaptures America's turbulent 1960s and early 1970s and reveals how Richard Nixon rose from the political grave to seize and hold the presidency.Perlstein's epic account begins in the blood and fire of the 1965 Watts riots, nine months after LyndonJohnson's historic landslide victory over Barry Goldwater appeared to herald a permanent liberal consensusin the United States. Yet the next year, scores of liberals were tossed out of Congress, America was more divided than ever, and a disgraced politician was on his way to a shocking comeback: Richard Nixon.Between 1965 and 1972, America experienced no less than a second civil war. Out of its ashes, the political world we know now was born. It was the era not only of Nixon, Johnson, Spiro Agnew, Hubert H. Humphrey, George McGovern, Richard J. Daley, and George Wallace but Abbie Hoffman, Ronald Reagan, Angela Davis, Ted Kennedy, Charles Manson, John Lindsay, and Jane Fonda. There are tantalizing glimpses of Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Jesse Jackson, John Kerry, and even of two ambitious young men named Karl Rove and William Clinton -- and a not so ambitious young man named George W. Bush.Cataclysms tell the story ofNixonland:- Angry blacks burning down their neighborhoods in cities across the land as white suburbanites defend home and hearth with shotguns- The student insurgency over the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention- The fissuring of the Democratic Party into warring factions manipulated by the \"dirty tricks\" of Nixon and his Committee to Re-Elect the President- Richard Nixon pledging a new dawn of national unity, governing more divisively than any president before him, then directing a criminal conspiracy, the Watergate cover-up, from the Oval OfficeThen, in November 1972, Nixon, harvesting the bitterness and resentment born of America's turmoil, was reelected in a landslide even bigger than Johnson's 1964 victory, not only setting the stage for his dramatic 1974 resignation but defining the terms of the ideological divide that characterizes America today.Filled with prodigious research and driven by a powerful narrative, Rick Perlstein's magisterial account of how America divided confirms his place as one of our country's most celebrated historians.",

Two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha, share the same bed, living in one room with their brother and parents. The routine of their hard impoverished life is shattered on 22 June 1941 when Hitler invades Russia. For the Metanov family, for Leningrad and particularly for Tatiana, life will never be the same again. On that fateful day, Tatiana meets a brash young man named Alexander. The family suffers as Hitler's army advances on Leningrad, and the Russian winter closes in. With bombs falling and the city under siege, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn inexorably to each other, but theirs is a love that could tear Tatiana's family apart, and at its heart lies a secret that could mean death to anyone who hears it. Confronted on the one hand by Hitler's vast war machine, and on the other by a Soviet system determined to crush the human spirit, Tatiana and Alexander are pitted against the very tide of history, at a turning point in the century that made the modern world.",

It is the pleasure of seeing revealed the humanity so often concealed in history.\" -Alfred KazinHenry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to World War I. Though a man of the modern world, Adams remained in temperament a child of the 18th century, his political ideals shaped by his presidential ancestors, great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams. The Education of Henry Adams is both a brilliant memoir and a profound meditation on the extraordinary developments in science, politics, religion, and society that so transformed the world as he knew it.For almost thirty years, The Library of America has presented America's best and most significant writing in acclaimed hardcover editions.

A dynasty spanning three generations, the Ambersons' pre-eminence as society's elite is threatened--not only by a hungry new breed of industrial entrepreneurs--but from its own arrogance and greed. At the center of the story is George Amberson Minafer, the pampered but pitiful, scion of the clan upon whose shoulders the fate of the family fortune will be won...or lost.At once an exciting chronicle of a family's rise to fortune and its tortured downfall, it is also a fascinating portrait of the forces that shaped American society.",

Now, on the theory that practice makes perfect, he sets out to bake peasant bread every week until he gets it right. He bakes his loaf from scratch. And because Alexander is nothing if not thorough, he really means from growing, harvesting, winnowing, threshing, and milling his own wheat. \u00a0 An original take on the six-thousand-year-old staple of life, 52 Loaves explores the nature of obsession, the meditative quality of ritual, the futility of trying to re-create something perfect, our deep connection to the earth, and the mysterious instinct that makes all of us respond to the aroma of baking bread.",

Matti is always putting herself before others, especially when it comes to her boyfriends. Jayden is the independent one who doesn't play by any dating rules, yet she is always in a monogamous relationship. These girls don't fit the typical mold of the female stereotype, as babies and marriage were never on their radar. Though, when one of the girls, Jayden, actually gets married, a rift starts to develop between them. In order to mend the rift, they go on a camping trip. What starts as a simple camping trip, quickly turns into a journey of discovery and self-revelation, as each girl comes face-to-face with the woman they have become. They are quickly forced to realize that friends may be forever, but time will always change the friendships.",
